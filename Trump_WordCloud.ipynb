didn\\'t \"choke\" he colluded or obstructed and it did the dems and crooked hillary no good.the real story is that president obama did nothing after being informed in august about russian meddling.

horrible conditions. russia and china condemned the launch.stock market hits new record high. confidence and enthusiasm abound. more great numbers coming out!the dow just broke 24000 for the first time (another all-time record). if the dems had won the presidential election the market would be down 50% from these levels and consumer confidence which is also at an all-time high would be “low and glum!”a disgraceful verdict in the kate steinle case! no wonder the people of our country are so angry with illegal immigration.the kate steinle killer came back and back over the weakly protected obama border always committing crimes and being violent and yet this info was not used in court. his exoneration is a complete travesty of justice. build the wall!the jury was not told the killer of

cuts in the history of our country. the bill is getting better and better. this is a once in a generation chance. obstructionist dems trying to block because they think it is too good and will not be

hard work and commitment!i had to fire general flynn because he lied to the vice president and the fbi. he has pled guilty to those lies. it is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful. there was nothing to hide!so general flynn lies to the fbi and his life is destroyed while crooked hillary clinton on that now famous fbi holiday “interrogation” with no swearing in and no recording lies many times...and nothing happens to her? rigged system or just a double standard?many people in our country are asking what the “justice” department is going to do about the fact that totally crooked hillary after receiving a subpoena from the united states congress deleted and “acid washed” 33000 emails? no justice!congratulations to @abc news for suspending brian ross for his

another fbi agent in charge.after years of comey with the phony and dishonest clinton investigation (and more) running the fbi its reputation is in tatters - worst in history! but fear not we will bring it back to greatness.people who lost money when the stock market went down 350 points based on the false and dishonest reporting of brian ross of @abc news (he has been suspended) should consider hiring a lawyer and suing abc for the damages this bad reporting has caused - many millions of dollars!report: “anti-trump fbi agent led clinton email probe”  now it all starts to make sense!democrats refusal to give even one vote for massive tax cuts is why we need republican roy moore to win in alabama. we need his vote on stopping crime illegal immigration border wall military pro life v.a. judges 2nd amendment and more. no to jones a pelosi/schumer puppet!putting pelosi/schumer liberal puppet jones into office in alabama would hurt our great republican agenda of low on

could be a big day for the stock market - and you!a must watch: legal scholar alan dershowitz was just on @foxandfriends talking of what is going on with respect to the greatest witch hunt in u.s.

thing the make america great again agenda needs is a liberal democrat in senate where we have so little margin for victory already. the pelosi/schumer puppet jones would vote against us 100% of the time. he’s bad on crime life border vets guns  military. vote roy moore!fines and penalties against wells fargo bank for their bad acts against their customers and others will not be dropped as has incorrectly been reported but will be pursued and if anything substantially increased. i will cut regs but make penalties severe when caught cheating!great evening last night in pensacola florida. arena was packed to the rafters the crowd was loud loving and really smart. they definitely get what’s going on. thank you pensacola!a big contingent of very enthusiastic roy moore fans at the rally

our country.fake news cnn made a vicious and purposeful mistake yesterday. they were caught red handed just like lonely brian ross at abc news (who should be immediately fired for his “mistake”). watch to see if @cnn fires those responsible or was it just gross incompetence?cnn’s slogan is cnn the most trusted name in news. everyone knows this is not true that this could in fact be a fraud on the american public. there are many outlets that are far more trusted than fake news cnn. their slogan should be cnn the least trusted name in news!heading to the great state of mississippi at the invitation of their popular and respected governor @philbryantms. look forward to seeing the new civil rights museum!.@daveweigel of the washington post just admitted that his picture was a fake (fraud?) showing an almost empty arena last night for my speech in pensacola when in fact he knew the arena was packed (as shown also on t.v.). fake news he should be fired.great army - navy game. army wins 14 to 13 and brings home the commander-in-chief’s trophy (last time was 1996). wow! congratulations!great army - navy game. army wins 14 to 13 and brings home the commander-in-chief’s

17 year low and companies are coming back into the usa. really good news and much more to come!very little discussion of all the purposely false and defamatory stories put out this week by the fake news media. they are out of control - correct reporting means nothing to them. major lies written then forced to be withdrawn after they are exposed...a stain on america!another false story this time in the failing @nytimes that i watch 4-8 hours of television a day - wrong!  also i seldom if ever watch cnn or msnbc both of which i consider fake news. i never watch don lemon who i once called the “dumbest man on television!” bad reporting.despite thousands of hours wasted and many millions of dollars spent the democrats have been unable to show any collusion with russia - so now they are moving on to the false accusations and fabricated stories of women who i don’t know and/or have never met. fake news!lightweight senator kirsten gillibrand a total flunky for chuck schumer and someone who would come to my office “begging” for campaign contributions not so long ago (and would do anything for them) is now in the ring fighting against trump. very disloyal to bill  crooked-used!the people of alabama will do the right thing. doug jones is pro-abortion weak on crime military and illegal immigration bad for gun owners and veterans and against the wall. jones is a pelosi/schumer puppet. roy moore will always vote with us. vote roy moore!consumer confidence is at an all-time high along with a record high stock market. unemployment is at a 17 year low. make america great again! working to pass massive tax cuts (looking good).congratulations to doug jones on a hard fought victory. the write-in votes played a very big factor but a win is a win. the people of alabama are great and the republicans will have another shot at this seat in a very short period of time. it never ends!the reason i originally endorsed luther strange (and his numbers went up mightily) is that i said roy moore will not be able to win the general election.  i was right! roy worked hard but the deck was stacked against him!wow more than 90% of fake news media coverage of me is negative with numerous forced retractions of untrue stories. hence my use of social media the only way to get the truth out. much of mainstream meadia has become a joke! @foxandfriendsif last night’s election proved anything it proved that we need to put up great republican candidates to increase the razor thin margins in both the house and senate.thank you omarosa for your service! i wish you continued success.republican tax cuts are looking very good. all are working hard. in the meantime the stock market hit another record high!congratulations to two great and hardworking guys corey lewandowski

bill. terrible individual mandate (obamacare)repealed. goes to the house tomorrow morning for final vote. if approved there will be a news conference at the white house at approximately 1:00 p.m.the tax cuts are so large and so meaningful and yet the fake news is working overtime to follow the lead of their friends the defeated dems and only demean. this is truly a case where the results will speak for themselves starting very soon. jobs jobs jobs!i would like to congratulate @senatemajldr on having done a fantastic job both strategically  politically on the passing in the senate of the massive tax cut  reform bill. i could have not asked for a better or more talented partner. our team will go onto many more victories!the massive tax cuts which the fake news media is desperate to write badly about so as to please their democrat bosses will soon be kicking in and will speak for themselves. companies are already making big payments to workers. dems want to raise taxes hate these big cuts!was @foxandfriends just named the most influential show in news? you deserve it - three great people! the many fake news hate shows should study your formula for success!home sales hit best numbers in 10 years! make america great againhouse democrats want a shutdown for the holidays in order to distract from the very popular just passed tax cuts. house republicans don’t let this happen. pass the c.r. today and keep our government open!our big and very popular tax cut and reform bill has taken on an unexpected new source of “love” - that is big companies and corporations showering their workers with bonuses. this is a phenomenon that nobody even thought of and now it is the rage. merry christmas!at some point and for the good of the country i predict we will start working with the democrats in a bipartisan fashion. infrastructure would be a perfect place to start. after having foolishly spent $7 trillion in the middle east it is time to start rebuilding our country!“the president has accomplished some absolutely historic things during this past year.” thank you charlie kirk of turning points usa. sadly the fake mainstream media will never talk about our accomplishments in their end of year reviews. we are compiling a long  beautiful list.will be signing the biggest ever tax cut and reform bill in 30 minutes in oval office. will also be signing a much needed 4 billion dollar missile defense bill.95% of americans will pay less or at worst the same amount of taxes (mostly far less). the dems only want to raise your taxes!congressman ron desantis is a brilliant young leader yale and then harvard law who would make a great governor of florida. he loves our country and is a true fighter!remember the most hated part of obamacare is the individual mandate which is being terminated under our just signed tax cut bill.how can fbi deputy director andrew mccabe the man in charge along with leakin’ james comey of the phony hillary clinton investigation (including her 33000 illegally deleted emails) be given $700000 for wife’s campaign by clinton puppets during investigation?fbi deputy director andrew mccabe is racing the clock to retire with full benefits. 90 days to go?!!!wow “fbi lawyer james baker reassigned” according to @foxnews.the stock market is setting record after record and unemployment is at a 17 year low. so many things accomplished by the trump administration perhaps more than any other president in first year. sadly will never be reported correctly by the fake news media!remember the republicans are 5-0 in congressional races this year. in senate i said roy m would lose in alabama and supported big luther strange - and roy lost. virginia candidate was not a “trumper” and he lost.  good republican candidates will win big!.@foxnews-fbi’s andrew mccabe “in addition to his wife getting all of this money from m (clinton puppet) he was using allegedly his fbi official email account to promote her campaign. you obviously cannot do this. these were the people who were investigating hillary clinton.”the fake news refuses to talk about how big and how strong our base is. they show fake polls just like they report fake news. despite only negative reporting we are doing well - nobody is going to beat us. make america great again!the tax cut/reform bill including massive alaska drilling and the repeal of the highly unpopular individual mandate brought it all together as to what an incredible year we had. don’t let the fake news convince you otherwise...and our insider polls are strong!people are proud to be saying merry christmas again. i am proud to have led the charge against the assault of our cherished and beautiful phrase. merry christmas!!!!!i hope everyone is having a great christmas then tomorrow it’s back to work in order to make america great again (which is happening faster than anyone anticipated)!based on the fact that the very unfair and unpopular individual mandate has been terminated as part of our tax cut bill which essentially repeals (over time) obamacare the democrats  republicans will eventually come together and develop a great new healthcare plan!wow @foxandfrlends  “dossier is bogus. clinton campaign dnc funded dossier. fbi cannot (after all of this time) verify claims in dossier of russia/trump collusion. fbi tainted.” and they used this crooked hillary pile of garbage as the basis for going after the trump campaign!just left west palm beach fire  rescue #2. met with great men and women as representatives of those who do so much for all of us. firefighters paramedics first responders - what amazing people they are!retail sales are at record numbers. we’ve got the economy going better than anyone ever dreamt - and you haven’t seen anything yet!caught red handed - very disappointed that china is allowing oil to go into north korea. there will never be a friendly solution to the north korea problem if this continues to happen!in the east it could be the coldest new year’s eve on record. perhaps we could use a little bit of that good old global warming that our country but not other countries was going to pay trillions of dollars to protect against. bundle up!while the fake news loves to talk about my so-called low approval rating @foxandfriends just showed that my rating on dec. 28 2017 was approximately the same as president obama on dec. 28 2009 which was 47%...and this despite massive negative trump coverage  russia hoax!why is the united states post office which is losing many billions of dollars a year while charging amazon and others so little to deliver their packages making amazon richer and the post office dumber and poorer? should be charging much more!the democrats have been told and fully understand that there can be no daca without the desperately needed wall at the southern border and an end to the horrible chain migration  ridiculous lottery system of immigration etc. we must protect our country at all cost!many reports of peaceful protests by iranian citizens fed up with regime’s corruption  its squandering of the nation’s wealth to fund terrorism abroad. iranian govt should respect their people’s rights including right to express themselves. the world is watching! #iranprotestson taxes: “this is the biggest corporate rate cut ever going back to the corporate income tax rate of roughly 80 years ago.this is a huge pro-growth stimulus for the economy. every year the obama wh overstated how the economy would grow. now real economics and jobs.” @wsj reporti use social media not because i like to but because it is the only way to fight a very dishonest and unfair “press” now often referred to as fake news media. phony and non-existent “sources” are being used more often than ever. many stories  reports a pure fiction!big protests in iran. the people are finally getting wise as to how their money and wealth is being stolen and squandered on terrorism. looks like they will not take it any longer. the usa is watching very closely for human rights violations!why would smart voters want to put democrats in congress in 2018 election when their policies will totally kill the great wealth created during the months since the election. people are much better off now not to mention isis va judges strong border 2nd a tax cuts  more?iran the number one state of sponsored terror with numerous violations of human rights occurring on an hourly basis has now closed down the internet so that peaceful demonstrators cannot communicate. not good!as our country rapidly grows stronger and smarter i want to wish all of my friends supporters enemies haters and even the very dishonest fake news media a happy and healthy new year. 2018 will be a great year for america!happy new year! we are making america great again and much faster than anyone thought possible!as i made very clear today our country needs the security of the wall on the southern border which must be part of any daca approval.it just shows everyone how broken and unfair our court system is when the opposing side in a case (such as daca) always runs to the 9th circuit and almost always wins before being reversed by higher courts.the fact that sneaky dianne feinstein who has on numerous occasions stated that collusion between trump/russia has not been found would release testimony in such an underhanded and possibly illegal way totally without authorization is a disgrace. must have tough primary!the single greatest witch hunt in american history continues. there was no collusion everybody including the dems knows there was no collusion  yet on and on it goes. russia  the world is laughing at the stupidity they are witnessing. republicans should finally take control!good news: toyota and mazda announce giant new huntsville alabama plant which will produce over 300000 cars and suv’s a year and employ 4000 people. companies are coming back to the u.s. in a very big way. congratulations alabama!disproven and paid for by democrats “dossier used to spy on trump campaign. did fbi use intel tool to influence the election?” @foxandfriends  did dems or clinton also pay russians? where are hidden and smashed dnc servers? where are crooked hillary emails?  what a mess!in new quinnipiac poll 66% of people feel the economy is “excellent or good.” that is the highest number ever recorded by this poll.“45 year low in illegal immigration this year.” @foxandfriendswith that being said i have personally directed the fix to the unmasking process since taking office and today’s vote is about foreign surveillance of foreign bad guys on foreign land. we need it! get smart!thank you adam levine the federalist in interview on @foxandfriends  “donald trump is the greatest president our country has ever seen.”small business poll has highest approval numbers in the polls history. all business is just at the beginning of something really special!chrysler is moving a massive plant from mexico to michigan reversing a years long opposite trend. thank you chrysler a very wise decision. the voters in michigan are very happy they voted for trump/pence. plenty of more to follow!democrat dianne feinstein should never have released secret committee testimony to the public without authorization. very disrespectful to committee members and possibly illegal. she blamed her poor decision on the fact she had a cold - a first!the democrats seem intent on having people and drugs pour into our country from the southern border risking thousands of lives in the process. it is my duty to protect the lives and safety of all americans. we must build a great wall think merit and end lottery  chain. usa!reason i canceled my trip to london is that i am not a big fan of the obama administration having sold perhaps the best located and finest embassy in london for “peanuts” only to build a new one in an off location for 1.2 billion dollars. bad deal. wanted me to cut ribbon-no!the so-called bipartisan daca deal presented yesterday to myself and a group of republican senators and congressmen was a big step backwards. wall was not properly funded chain  lottery were made worse and usa would be forced to take large numbers of people from high crime.........countries which are doing badly. i want a merit based system of immigration and people who will help take our country to the next level. i want safety and security for our people. i want to stop the massive inflow of drugs. i want to fund our military not do a dem defund........because of the democrats not being interested in life and safety daca has now taken a big step backwards. the dems will threaten “shutdown” but what they are really doing is shutting down our military at a time we need it most. get smart make america great again!the language used by me at the daca meeting was tough but this was not the language used. what was really tough was the outlandish proposal made - a big setback for daca!sadly democrats want to stop paying our troops and government workers in order to give a sweetheart deal not a fair deal for daca. take care of our military and our country first!never said anything derogatory about haitians other than haiti is obviously a very poor and troubled country. never said “take them out.” made up by dems. i have a wonderful relationship with haitians. probably should record future meetings - unfortunately no trust!yesterday was a big day for the stock market. jobs are coming back to america. chrysler is coming back to the usa from mexico and many others will follow. tax cut money to employees is pouring into our economy with many more companies announcing. american business is hot again!the democrats are all talk and no action. they are doing nothing to fix daca. great opportunity missed. too bad!america first!yesterday was another big day for jobs and the stock market. chrysler coming back to u.s. (michigan) from mexico and many more companies paying out tax cut money to employees. if dems won in november market would have tanked! it was headed for disaster.i don’t believe the democrats really want to see a deal on daca. they are all talk and no action. this is the time but day by day they are blowing the one great opportunity they have. too bad!so much fake news is being reported. they don’t even try to get it right or correct it when they are wrong. they promote the fake book of a mentally deranged author who knowingly writes false information. the mainstream media is crazed that we won the election!the wall street journal stated falsely that i said to them “i have a good relationship with kim jong un” (of n. korea). obviously i didn’t say that. i said “i’d have a good relationship with kim jong un” a big difference. fortunately we now record conversations with reporters......and they knew exactly what i said and meant. they just wanted a story. fake news!daca is probably dead because the democrats don’t really want it they just want to talk and take desperately needed money away from our military.i as president want people coming into our country who are going to help us become strong and great again people coming in through a system based on merit. no more lotteries! #america first“president trump is not getting the credit he deserves for the economy. tax cut bonuses to more than 2000000 workers. most explosive stock market rally that we’ve seen in modern times. 18000 to 26000 from election and grounded in profitability and growth. all trump not 0......big unnecessary regulation cuts made it all possible” (among many other things). “president trump reversed the policies of president obama and reversed our economic decline.” thank you stuart varney.  @foxandfriendsstatement by me last night in florida: “honestly i don’t think the democrats want to make a deal. they talk about daca but they don’t want to help..we are ready willing and able to make a deal but they don’t want to. they don’t want security at the border they don’t want........to stop drugs they want to take money away from our military which we cannot do.” my standard is very simple america first  make america great again!senator dicky durbin totally misrepresented what was said at the daca meeting. deals can’t get made when there is no trust! durbin blew daca and is hurting our military.we must have security at our very dangerous southern border and we must have a great wall to help protect us and to help stop the massive inflow of drugs pouring into our country!the democrats want to shut down the government over amnesty for all and border security. the biggest loser will be our rapidly rebuilding military at a time we need it more than ever. we need a merit based system of immigration and we need it now! no more dangerous lottery.do you notice the fake news mainstream media never likes covering the great and record setting economic news but rather talks about anything negative or that can be turned into the negative. the russian collusion hoax is dead except as it pertains to the dems. public gets it!“90% of trump 2017 news coverage was negative” -and much of it contrived!@foxandfriendsunemployment for black americans is the lowest ever recorded. trump approval ratings with black americans has doubled. thank you and it will get even (much) better! @foxnewsnew report from doj  dhs shows that nearly 3 in 4 individuals convicted of terrorism-related charges are foreign-born. we have submitted to congress a list of resources and reforms....eric trump on @foxandfriends  now!despite some very corrupt and dishonest media coverage there are many great reporters i respect and lots of good news for the american people to be proud of!isis is in retreat our economy is booming investments and jobs are pouring back into the country and so much more! together there is nothing we can’t overcome--even a very biased media. we are making america great again!the wall is the wall it has never changed or evolved from the first day i conceived of it. parts will be of necessity see through and it was never intended to be built in areas where there is natural protection such as mountains wastelands or tough rivers or water.........the wall will be paid for directly or indirectly or through longer term reimbursement by mexico which has a ridiculous $71 billion dollar trade surplus with the u.s. the $20 billion dollar wall is “peanuts” compared to what mexico makes from the u.s. nafta is a bad joke!will be going to pennsylvania today in order to give my total support to rick saccone running for congress in a special election (march 13). rick is a great guy. we need more republicans to continue our already successful agenda!we need the wall for the safety and security of our country. we need the wall to help stop the massive inflow of drugs from mexico now rated the number one most dangerous country in the world. if there is no wall there is no deal!chip should be part of a long term solution not a 30 day or short term extension!a government shutdown will be devastating to our military...something the dems care very little about!house of representatives needs to pass government funding bill tonight. so important for our country - our military needs it!government funding bill past last night in the house of representatives. now democrats are needed if it is to pass in the senate - but they want illegal immigration and weak borders. shutdown coming? we need more republican victories in 2018!just signed 702 bill to reauthorize foreign intelligence collection. this is not the same fisa law that was so wrongly abused during the election. i will always do the right thing for our country and put the safety of the american people first!excellent preliminary meeting in oval with @senschumer - working on solutions for security and our great military together with @senatemajldr mcconnell and @speakerryan. making progress - four week extension would be best!not looking good for our great military or safety  security on the very dangerous southern border. dems want a shutdown in order to help diminish the great success of the tax cuts and what they are doing for our booming economy.democrats are far more concerned with illegal immigrants than they are with our great military or safety at our dangerous southern border. they could have easily made a deal but decided to play shutdown politics instead. #weneedmorerepublicansin18 in order to power through mess!this is the one year anniversary of my presidency and the democrats wanted to give me a nice present. #democratshutdownfor those asking the republicans only have 51 votes in the senate and they need 60. that is why we need to win more republicans in 2018 election! we can then be even tougher on  crime (and border) and even better to our military  veterans!#america first!democrats are holding our military hostage over their desire to have unchecked illegal immigration. can’t let that happen!beautiful weather all over our great country a perfect day for all women to march. get out there now to celebrate the historic milestones and unprecedented economic success and wealth creation that has taken place over the last 12 months. lowest female unemployment in 18 years!unprecedented success for our country in so many ways since the election. record stock market strong on military crime borders  isis judicial strength  numbers lowest unemployment for women  all massive tax cuts end of individual mandate - and so much more. big 2018!the trump administration has terminated more unnecessary regulation in just twelve months than any other administration has terminated during their full term in office no matter what the length. the good news is there is much more to come!eric trump on @judgejeanine on @foxnews now!great to see how hard republicans are fighting for our military and safety at the border. the dems just want illegal immigrants to pour into our nation unchecked. if stalemate continues republicans should go to 51% (nuclear option) and vote on real long term budget no c.r.’s!thank you to brad blakeman on @foxnews for grading year one of my presidency with an “a”-and likewise to doug schoen for the very good grade and statements. working hard!the democrats are turning down services and security for citizens in favor of services and security for non-citizens. not good!democrats have shut down our government in the interests of their far left base. they don’t want to do it but are powerless!big win for republicans as democrats cave on shutdown. now i want a big win for everyone including republicans democrats and daca but especially for our great military and border security. should be able to get there. see you at the negotiating table!even crazy jim acosta of fake news cnn agrees: “trump world and wh sources dancing in end zone: trump wins again...schumer and dems caved...gambled and lost.” thank you for your honesty jim!in one of the biggest stories in a long time the fbi says it is now missing five months worth of lovers strzok - page texts perhaps 50000 all in prime time. wow!in one of the biggest stories in a long time the fbi now says it is missing five months worth of lovers strzok-page texts perhaps 50000 and all in prime time. wow!nobody knows for sure that the republicans  democrats will be able to reach a deal on daca by february 8 but everyone will be trying....with a big additional focus put on military strength and border security. the dems have just learned that a shutdown is not the answer!thank you to general john kelly who is doing a fantastic job and all of the staff and others in the white house for a job well done. long hours and fake reporting makes your job more difficult but it is always great to win and few have won more than us!where are the 50000 important text messages between fbi lovers lisa page and peter strzok?  blaming samsung!cryin’ chuck schumer fully understands especially after his humiliating defeat that if there is no wall there is no daca. we must have safety and security together with a strong military for our great people!tremendous investment by companies from all over the world being made in america. there has never been anything like it. now disney j.p. morgan chase and many others. massive regulation reduction and tax cuts are making us a powerhouse again. long way to go!

#magadaca has been made increasingly difficult by the fact that cryin’ chuck schumer took such a beating over the shutdown that he is unable to act on immigration!thank you to brandon judd of the national border patrol council for his strong statement on @foxandfriends that we very badly need the wall. must also end loophole of “catch  release” and clean up the legal and other procedures at the border now for safety  security reasons.taliban targeted innocent afghans brave police in kabul today. our thoughts and prayers go to the victims and first responders. we will not allow the taliban to win!i have offered daca a wonderful deal including a doubling in the number of recipients  a twelve year pathway to citizenship for two reasons: (1) because the republicans want to fix a long time terrible problem. (2) to show that democrats do not want to solve daca only use it!democrats are not interested in border safety  security or in the funding and rebuilding of our military. they are only interested in obstruction!somebody please inform jay-z that because of my policies black unemployment has just been reported to be at the lowest rate ever recorded!our economy is better than it has been in many decades. businesses are coming back to america like never before. chrysler as an example is leaving mexico and coming back to the usa. unemployment is nearing record lows. we are on the right track!heading to beautiful west virginia to be with great members of the republican party. will be planning infrastructure and discussing immigration and daca not easy when we have no support from the democrats. not one dem voted for our tax cut bill! need more republicans in ‘18.march 5th is rapidly approaching and the democrats are doing nothing about daca. they resist blame complain and obstruct - and do nothing. start pushing nancy pelosi and the dems to work out a daca fix now!thank you for all of the nice compliments and reviews on the state of the union speech. 45.6 million people watched the highest number in history. @foxnews beat every other network for the first time ever with 11.7 million people tuning in. delivered from the heart!the democrats just aren’t calling about daca. nancy pelosi and chuck schumer have to get moving fast or they’ll disappoint you again. we have a great chance to make a deal or blame the dems! march 5th is coming up fast.the top leadership and investigators of the fbi and the justice department have politicized the sacred investigative process in favor of democrats and against republicans - something which would have been unthinkable just a short time ago. rank  file are great people!“you had hillary clinton and the democratic party try to hide the fact that they gave money to gps fusion to create a dossier which was used by their allies in the obama administration to convince a court misleadingly by all accounts to spy on the trump team.” tom fitton jwrasmussen just announced that my approval rating jumped to 49% a far better number than i had in winning the election and higher than certain “sacred cows.” other trump polls are way up also. so why does the media refuse to write this? oh well someday!this memo totally vindicates “trump” in probe. but the russian witch hunt goes on and on. their was no collusion and there was no obstruction (the word now used because after one year of looking endlessly and finding nothing collusion is dead). this is an american disgrace!great jobs numbers and finally after many years rising wages- and nobody even talks about them. only russia russia russia despite the fact that after a year of looking there is no collusion!“the four page memo released friday reports the disturbing fact about how the fbi and fisa appear to have been used to influence the 2016 election and its aftermath....the fbi failed to inform the fisa court that the clinton campaign had funded the dossier....the fbi became.......a tool of anti-trump political actors. this is unacceptable in a democracy and ought to alarm anyone who wants the fbi to be a nonpartisan enforcer of the law....the fbi wasn’t straight with congress as it hid most of these facts from investigators.” wall street journalmy thoughts and prayers are with all of the victims involved in this mornings train collision in south carolina. thank you to our incredible first responders for the work they’ve done!congratulations to the philadelphia eagles on a great super bowl victory!the democrats are pushing for universal healthcare while thousands of people are marching in the uk because their u system is going broke and not working. dems want to greatly raise taxes for really bad and non-personal medical care. no thanks!thank you to @foxandfriends for exposing the truth. perhaps that’s why your ratings are soooo much better than your untruthful competition!little adam schiff who is desperate to run for higher office is one of the biggest liars and leakers in washington right up there with comey warner brennan and clapper! adam leaves closed committee hearings to illegally leak confidential information. must be stopped!any deal on daca that does not include strong border security and the desperately needed wall is a total waste of time. march 5th is rapidly approaching and the dems seem not to care about daca. make a deal!representative devin nunes a man of tremendous courage and grit may someday be recognized as a great american hero for what he has exposed and what he has had to endure!so disgraceful that a person illegally in our country killed @colts linebacker edwin jackson. this is just one of many such preventable tragedies. we must get the dems to get tough on the border and with illegal immigration fast!in the “old days” when good news was reported the stock market would go up. today when good news is reported the stock market goes down. big mistake and we have so much good (great) news about the economy!new fbi texts are bombshells!the budget agreement today is so important for our great military. it ends the dangerous sequester and gives secretary mattis what he needs to keep america great. republicans and democrats must support our troops and support this bill!will be heading over shortly to make remarks at the national prayer breakfast in washington. great religious and political leaders and many friends including t.v. producer mark burnett of our wonderful 14 season apprentice triumph will be there. looking forward to seeing all!i will be meeting with henry kissinger at 1:45pm. will be discussing north korea china and the middle east.wow! -senator mark warner got caught having extensive contact with a lobbyist for a russian oligarch. warner did not want a “paper trail” on a “private” meeting (in london) he requested with steele of fraudulent dossier fame. all tied into crooked hillary.just signed bill. our military will now be stronger than ever before. we love and need our military and gave them everything — and more. first time this has happened in a long time. also means jobs jobs jobs!without more republicans in congress we were forced to increase spending on things we do not like or want in order to finally after many years of depletion take care of our military. sadly we needed some dem votes for passage. must elect more republicans in 2018 election!costs on non-military lines will never come down if we do not elect more republicans in the 2018 election and beyond. this bill is a big victory for our military but much waste in order to get dem votes. fortunately daca not included in this bill negotiations to start now!jobless claims have dropped to a 45 year low!the democrats sent a very political and long response memo which they knew because of sources and methods (and more) would have to be heavily redacted whereupon they would blame the white house for lack of transparency. told them to re-do and send back in proper form!according to the @nytimes a russian sold phony secrets on “trump” to the u.s. asking price was $10 million brought down to $1 million to be paid over time. i hope people are now seeing  understanding what is going on here. it is all now starting to come out - drain the swamp!peoples lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation. some are true and some are false. some are old and some are new. there is no recovery for someone falsely accused - life and career are gone. is there no such thing any longer as due process?“my view is that not only has trump been vindicated in the last several weeks about the mishandling of the dossier and the lies about the clinton/dnc dossier it shows that he’s been victimized. he’s been victimized by the obama administration who were using all sorts of...........agencies not just the fbi  doj now the state department to dig up dirt on him in the days leading up to the election. comey had conversations with donald trump which i don’t believe were accurate...he leaked information (corrupt).” tom fitton of judicial watch on @foxnewsrepublicans want to fix daca far more than the democrats do. the dems had all three branches of government back in 2008-2011 and they decided not to do anything about daca. they only want to use it as a campaign issue. vote republican!so many positive things going on for the u.s.a. and the fake news media just doesn’t want to go there. same negative stories over and over again! no wonder the people no longer trust the media whose approval ratings are correctly at their lowest levels in history!    #maga4.2 million hard working americans have already received a large bonus and/or pay increase because of our recently passed tax cut  jobs bill....and it will only get better! we are far ahead of schedule.rep. lou barletta a great republican from pennsylvania who was one of my very earliest supporters will make a fantastic senator. he is strong  smart loves pennsylvania  loves our country! voted for tax cuts unlike bob casey who listened to tax hikers pelosi and schumer!just spoke to @johnkasich to express condolences and prayers to all for the horrible shooting of two great police officers from @westervillepd. this is a true tragedy!this will be a big week for infrastructure. after so stupidly spending $7 trillion in the middle east it is now time to start investing in our country!thank you to sue kruczek who lost her wonderful and talented son nick to the opioid scourge for your kind words while on @foxandfriends. we are fighting this terrible epidemic hard - nick will not have died in vain!our infrastructure plan has been put forward and has received great reviews by everyone except of course the democrats. after many years we have taken care of our military now we have to fix our roads bridges tunnels airports and more. bipartisan make deal dems?negotiations on daca have begun. republicans want to make a deal and democrats say they want to make a deal. wouldn’t it be great if we could finally after so many years solve the daca puzzle. this will be our last chance there will never be another opportunity! march 5th.my prayers and condolences to the families of the victims of the terrible florida shooting. no child teacher or anyone else should ever feel unsafe in an american school.just spoke to governor rick scott. we are working closely with law enforcement on the terrible florida school shooting.so many signs that the florida shooter was mentally disturbed even expelled from school for bad and erratic behavior. neighbors and classmates knew he was a big problem. must always report such instances to authorities again and again!while the republicans and democrats in congress are working hard to come up with a solution to daca they should be strongly considering a system of merit based immigration so that we will have the people ready willing and able to help all of those companies moving into the usa!the schumer-rounds-collins immigration bill would be a total catastrophe. @dhsgov says it would be “the end of immigration enforcement in america.” it creates a giant amnesty (including for dangerous criminals) doesn’t build the wall expands chain migration keeps the visa......lottery continues deadly catch-and-release and bars enforcement even for future illegal immigrants. voting for this amendment would be a vote against law enforcement and a vote for open borders. if dems are actually serious about daca they should support the grassley bill!i will be leaving for florida today to meet with some of the bravest people on earth - but people whose lives have been totally shattered. am also working with congress on many fronts.cannot believe how badly daca recipients have been treated by the democrats...totally abandoned! republicans are still working hard.russia started their anti-us campaign in 2014 long before i announced that i would run for president. the results of the election were not impacted. the trump campaign did nothing wrong - no collusion!melania and i met such incredible people last night in broward county florida. will never forget them or the evening!“charges deal don a big win” written by michael goodwin of the @nypost succinctly states that “the russians had no impact on the election results.” there was no collusion with the trump campaign. “she lost the old-fashioned way by being a terrible candidate. case closed.”deputy a.g. rod rosenstein stated at the news conference: “there is no allegation in the indictment that any american was a knowing participant in this illegal activity. there is no allegation in the indictment that the charged conduct altered the outcome of the 2016 election.funny how the fake news media doesn’t want to say that the russian group was formed in 2014 long before my run for president. maybe they knew i was going to run even though i didn’t know!just like they don’t want to solve the daca problem why didn’t the democrats pass gun control legislation when they had both the house  senate during the obama administration. because they didn’t want to and now they just talk!very sad that the fbi missed all of the many signals sent out by the florida school shooter. this is not acceptable. they are spending too much time trying to prove russian collusion with the trump campaign - there is no collusion. get back to the basics and make us all proud!general mcmaster forgot to say that the results of the 2016 election were not impacted or changed by the russians and that the only collusion was between russia and crooked h the dnc and the dems. remember the dirty dossier uranium speeches emails and the podesta company!never gotten over the fact that obama was able to send $1.7 billion dollars in cash to iran and nobody in congress the fbi or justice called for an investigation!finally liddle’ adam schiff the leakin’ monster of no control is now blaming the obama administration for russian meddling in the 2016 election. he is finally right about something. obama was president knew of the threat and did nothing. thank you adam!i never said russia did not meddle in the election i said “it may be russia or china or another country or group or it may be a 400 pound genius sitting in bed and playing with his computer.” the russian “hoax” was that the trump campaign colluded with russia - it never did!now that adam schiff is starting to blame president obama for russian meddling in the election he is probably doing so as yet another excuse that the democrats lead by their fearless leader crooked hillary clinton lost the 2016 election. but wasn’t i a great candidate?if it was the goal of russia to create discord disruption and chaos within the u.s. then with all of the committee hearings investigations and party hatred they have succeeded beyond their wildest dreams. they are laughing their asses off in moscow. get smart america!great pollster john mclaughlin now has the gop up in the generic congressional ballot. big gain over last 4 weeks. i guess people are loving the big tax cuts given them by the republicans the cuts the dems want to take away. we need more republicans!my great friends from nascar are having their big race today the daytona 500. brian france and the france family are special people. enjoy the race!just watched a very insecure oprah winfrey who at one point i knew very well interview a panel of people on 60 minutes. the questions were biased and slanted the facts incorrect. hope oprah runs so she can be exposed and defeated just like all of the others!have a great but very reflective president’s day!obama was president up to and beyond the 2016 election. so why didn’t he do something about russian meddling?.@mittromney has announced he is running for the senate from the wonderful state of utah. he will make a great senator and worthy successor to @orrinhatch and has my full support and endorsement!the u.s. economy is looking very good in my opinion even better than anticipated. companies are pouring back into our country reversing the long term trend of leaving. the unemployment numbers are looking great and regulations  taxes have been massively cut! jobs jobs jobs“the faith of donald trump” a book just out by david brody and scott lamb is a very interesting read. enjoy!thank you to @foxandfriends for the great timeline on all of the failures the obama administration had against russia including crimea syria and so much more. we are now starting to win again!“there is no serious person out there who would suggest somehow that you could even rig america’s elections there’s no evidence that that has happened in the past or that it will happen this time and so i’d invite mr. trump to stop whining and make his case to get votes.” .........the president obama quote just before election. that’s because he thought crooked hillary was going to win and he didn’t want to “rock the boat.” when i easily won the electoral college the whole game changed and the russian excuse became the narrative of the dems.republicans are now leading the generic poll perhaps because of the popular tax cuts which the dems want to take away. actually they want to raise you taxes substantially. also they want to do nothing on daca r’s want to fix!matt schlapp and cpac are getting ready for another exciting event. big difference from those days when president obama held the white house. you’ve come a long way matt!hope republicans in the great state of pennsylvania challenge the new “pushed” congressional map all the way to the supreme court if necessary. your original was correct! don’t let the dems take elections away from you so that they can raise taxes  waste money!i have been much tougher on russia than obama just look at the facts. total fake news!a woman i don’t know and to the best of my knowledge never met is on the front page of the fake news washington post saying i kissed her (for two minutes yet) in the lobby of trump tower 12 years ago. never happened! who would do this in a public space with live security..........cameras running. another false accusation. why doesn’t @washingtonpost report the story of the women taking money to make up stories about me? one had her home mortgage paid off. only @foxnews so reported...doesn’t fit the mainstream media narrative.bad ratings @cnn  @msnbc got scammed when they covered the anti-trump russia rally wall-to-wall. they probably knew it was fake news but because it was a rally against me they pushed it hard anyway. two really dishonest newscasters but the public is wise!@cnn @msnbc whether we are republican or democrat we must now focus on strengthening background checks!the great billy graham is dead. there was nobody like him! he will be missed by christians and all religions. a very special man.question: if all of the russian meddling took place during the obama administration right up to january 20th why aren’t they the subject of the investigation? why didn’t obama do something about the meddling? why aren’t dem crimes under investigation? ask jeff sessions!i never said “give teachers guns” like was stated on fake news @cnn  @nbc. what i said was to look at the possibility of giving “concealed guns to gun adept teachers with military or special training experience - only the best. 20% of teachers a lot would now be able to....immediately fire back if a savage sicko came to a school with bad intentions. highly trained teachers would also serve as a deterrent to the cowards that do this. far more assets at much less cost than guards. a “gun free” school is a magnet for bad people. attacks would end!....history shows that a school shooting lasts on average 3 minutes. it takes police  first responders approximately 5 to 8 minutes to get to site of crime. highly trained gun adept teachers/coaches would solve the problem instantly before police arrive. great deterrent!....if a potential “sicko shooter” knows that a school has a large number of very weapons talented teachers (and others) who will be instantly shooting the sicko will never attack that school. cowards won’t go there...problem solved. must be offensive defense alone won’t work!i will be strongly pushing comprehensive background checks with an emphasis on mental health. raise age to 21 and end sale of bump stocks! congress is in a mood to finally do something on this issue - i hope!what many people don’t understand or don’t want to understand is that wayne chris and the folks who work so hard at the @nra are great people and great american patriots. they love our country and will do the right thing.                  make america great again!will be meeting with lawmakers today at 11:30 a.m. to discuss school safety.  next week it will be with our nation’s governors. it’s been many years of all talk no action. we’ll get it done!“school shooting survivor says he quit @cnn town hall after refusing scripted question.” @tuckercarlson. just like so much of cnn fake news. that’s why their ratings are so bad! msnbc may be worse.ms-13 gang members are being removed by our great ice and border patrol agents by the thousands but these killers come back in from el salvador and through mexico like water. el salvador just takes our money and mexico must help more with this problem. we need the wall!cpac today!my daughter ivanka just arrived in south korea. we cannot have a better or smarter person representing our country.for those of you who are still interested the democrats have totally forgotten about daca. not a lot of interest on this subject from them!thank you to the great men and women of the united states @secretservice for a job well done!armed educators (and trusted people who work within a school) love our students and will protect them. very smart people. must be firearms adept  have annual training. should get yearly bonus. shootings will not happen again - a big  very inexpensive deterrent. up to states.democrat judges have totally redrawn election lines in the great state of pennsylvania. @foxnews. this is very unfair to republicans and to our country as a whole. must be appealed to the united states supreme court asap!unemployment claims are at the lowest level since 1973. much of this has to do with the massive cutting of unnecessary and job killing regulations!dems are no longer talking daca! “out of sight out of mind” they say. daca beneficiaries should not be happy. nancy pelosi truly doesn’t care about them. republicans stand ready to make a deal!big cpac straw poll results: 93% approve of the job president trump is doing (thank you!). 50% say president trump should tweet more or same (funny!). 79% say republicans in congress should do a better job of working with president trump (starting to happen).the democrat memo response on government surveillance abuses is a total political and legal bust. just confirms all of the terrible things that were done. so illegal!dem memo: fbi did not disclose who the clients were - the clinton campaign and the dnc. wow!“russians had no compromising information on donald trump” @foxnews  of course not because there is none and never was. this whole witch hunt is an illegal disgrace...and obama did nothing about russia!“congressman schiff omitted and distorted key facts” @foxnews  so what else is new. he is a total phony!“he’s got a very good point. somebody in the justice department has a treasure trove of evidence of mrs. clinton’s criminality at her own hands or through others that ought to be investigated. i fully agree with the president on that.” @judgenapolitano on @marthamaccallum show“i’ve been skeptical about the collusion and obstruction claims for the last year. i just don’t see the evidence....in terms of the collusion it’s all a bit implausible based on the evidence we have.”  jonathan turley on @foxnews“we’ve seen no evidence of collusion....i have seen nothing the firing of james comey and all of the aftermath that suggests that the president has obstructed justice because he’s exercising his power as the president of the u.s. i just don’t see it.”  judge ken starrwitch hunt!i want to encourage all of my many texas friends to vote in the primary for governor greg abbott senator ted cruz lt. gov. dan patrick and attorney general ken paxton. they are helping me to make america great again! vote early or on march

approved. also big help on cutting regs. i am with him in his re-election all the way!big legal win today. u.s. judge sided with the trump administration and rejected the attempt to stop the government from building a great border wall on the southern border. now this important project can go forward!the heritage foundation has just stated that 64% of the trump agenda is already done faster than even ronald reagan. “we’re blown away” said thomas binion of heritage president trump “is very active very conservative and very effective. huge volume  spectrum of issues.”i have decided that sections of the wall that california wants built now will not be built until the whole wall is approved. big victory yesterday with ruling from the courts that allows us to proceed. our country must have border security!45 year low on illegal border crossings this year. ice and border patrol agents are doing a great job for our country. ms-13 thugs being hit hard.why is a.g. jeff sessions asking the inspector general to investigate potentially massive fisa abuse. will take forever has no prosecutorial power and already late with reports on comey etc. isn’t the i.g. an obama guy? why not use justice department lawyers? disgraceful!many ideas some good  some not so good emerged from our bipartisan meeting on school safety yesterday at the white house. background checks a big part of conversation. gun free zones are proven targets of killers. after many years a bill should emerge. respect 2nd amendment!our steel and aluminum industries (and many others) have been decimated by decades of unfair trade and bad policy with countries from around the world. we must not let our country companies and workers be taken advantage of any longer. we want free fair and smart trade!jobless claims at a 49 year low!manufacturing growing at the fastest pace in almost two decades!alex baldwin whose dieing mediocre career was saved by his impersonation of me on snl now says playing djt was agony for him. alex it was also agony for those who were forced to watch. you were terrible. bring back darrell hammond much funnier and a far greater talent!when a country (usa) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with trade wars are good and easy to win. example when we are down $100 billion with a certain country and they get cute don’t trade anymore-we win big. it’s easy!alec baldwin whose dying mediocre career was saved by his terrible impersonation of me on snl now says playing me was agony. alec it was agony for those who were forced to watch. bring back darrell hammond funnier and a far greater talent!we must protect our country and our workers. our steel industry is in bad shape. if you don’t have steel you don’t have a country!when a country taxes our products coming in at say 50% and we tax the same product coming into our country at zero not fair or smart. we will soon be starting reciprocal taxes so that we will charge the same thing as they charge us. $800 billion trade deficit-have no choice!heading to billy graham funeral. a special man!the united states has an $800 billion dollar yearly trade deficit because of our “very stupid” trade deals and policies. our jobs and wealth are being given to other countries that have taken advantage of us for years. they laugh at what fools our leaders have been. no more!if the e.u. wants to further increase their already massive tariffs and barriers on u.s. companies doing business there we will simply apply a tax on their cars which freely pour into the u.s. they make it impossible for our cars (and more) to sell there. big trade imbalance!the gridiron dinner last night was great fun. i am accomplishing a lot in washington and have never had a better time doing something and especially since this is for the american people!we are on the losing side of almost all trade deals. our friends and enemies have taken advantage of the u.s. for many years. our steel and aluminum industries are dead. sorry it’s time for a change! make america great again!we have large trade deficits with mexico and canada. nafta which is under renegotiation right now has been a bad deal for u.s.a. massive relocation of companies  jobs. tariffs on steel and aluminum will only come off if new  fair nafta agreement is signed. also canada must.....treat our farmers much better. highly restrictive. mexico must do much more on stopping drugs from pouring into the u.s. they have not done what needs to be done. millions of people addicted and dying.to protect our country we must protect american steel! #america firstwhy did the obama administration start an investigation into the trump campaign (with zero proof of wrongdoing) long before the election in november? wanted to discredit so crooked h would win. unprecedented. bigger than watergate! plus obama did nothing about russian meddling.it’s march 5th and the democrats are nowhere to be found on daca. gave them 6 months they just don’t care. where are they? we are ready to make a deal!the new fake news narrative is that there is chaos in the white house. wrong! people will always come  go and i want strong dialogue before making a final decision. i still have some people that i want to change (always seeking perfection). there is no chaos only great energy!total inaction on daca by dems. where are you? a deal can be made!lowest rated oscars in history. problem is we don’t have stars anymore - except your president (just kidding of course)!federal judge in maryland has just ruled that “president trump has the right to end daca.” president obama had 8 years to fix this problem and didn’t. i am waiting for the dems they are running for the hills!possible progress being made in talks with north korea. for the first time in many years a serious effort is being made by all parties concerned. the world is watching and waiting! may be false hope but the u.s. is

white house. we have to protect  build our steel and aluminum industries while at the same time showing great flexibility and cooperation toward those that are real friends  and treat us fairly on

completed a very good one for the world. time and place to be determined.we are deeply saddened by the tragic situation in yountville and mourn the loss of three incredible women who cared for our veterans.chinese president xi xinping and i spoke at length about the meeting with kim jong un of north korea. president xi told me he appreciates that the u.s. is working to solve the problem

with north korea. also discussing opening up japan to much better trade with the u.s. currently have a massive $100 billion trade deficit. not fair or sustainable. it will all work out!heading to moon

me a lot. also tough on crime  border. loves 2nd a  vetsnorth korea has not conducted a missile test since november 28 2017 and has promised not to do so through our meetings. i believe they will honor that commitment!in the first hours after hearing that north korea’s leader wanted to meet with me to talk denuclearization and that missile launches will end the press was startled  amazed.they couldn’t believe it. but by the following morning the news became fake.they said so what who cares!the european union wonderful countries who treat the u.s. very badly on trade are complaining about the tariffs on steel  aluminum. if they drop their horrific barriers  tariffs on u.s. products going in we will likewise drop ours. big deficit. if not we tax cars etc. fair!the failing new york times purposely wrote a false story stating that i am unhappy with my legal team on the russia case and am going to add another lawyer to help out. wrong. i am very happy with my lawyers john dowd ty cobb and jay sekulow. they are doing a great job and........have shown conclusively that there was no collusion with russia..just excuse for losing. the only collusion was that done by the dnc the democrats and crooked hillary. the writer of the story maggie haberman a hillary flunky knows nothing about me and is not given access.the republicans are 5-0 in recent congressional races a point which the fake news media continuously fails to mention. i backed and campaigned for all of the winners. they give me credit for one. hopefully rick saccone will be another big win on tuesday.the democrats continue to obstruct the confirmation of hundreds of good and talented people who are needed to run our government...a record in u.s. history. state department ambassadors and many others are being slow walked. senate must approve now!rasmussen and others have my approval ratings at around 50% which is higher than obama and yet the political pundits love saying my approval ratings are “somewhat low.” they know they are lying when they say it. turn off the show - fake news!secretary of commerce wilbur ross will be speaking with representatives of the european union about eliminating the large tariffs and barriers they use against the u.s.a. not fair to our farmers and manufacturers.very strong improvement and strengthening of background checks will be fully backed by white house. legislation moving forward. bump stocks will soon be out. highly trained expert teachers will be allowed to conceal carry subject to state law. armed guards ok deterrent!...........on 18 to 21 age

taxes weak on crime and border.the house intelligence committee has after a 14 month long in-depth investigation found no evidence of collusion or coordination between the trump campaign and russia to

incredible @cabinet secretaries are testifying on the hill this morning on the need to rebuild our nation’s crumbling infrastructure. we need to build fast  we need to build for our future. thank you

with low taxes unparalleled innovation fair trade and an ever expanding labor force leading the way! #magawe do have a trade deficit with canada as we do with almost all countries (some of them massive). p.m. justin trudeau of canada a very good guy doesn’t like saying that canada has a surplus vs. the u.s.(negotiating) but they do...they almost all do...and that’s how i know!continuing to monitor the heartbreaking bridge collapse at fiu - so tragic. many brave first responders rushed in to save lives. thank you for your courage. praying this evening for all who are affected.our thoughts and prayers go out to the families and loved ones of the brave troops lost in the helicopter crash on the iraq-syria border yesterday. their sacrifice in service to our country will never be forgotten.andrew mccabe fired a great day for the hard working men and women of the fbi - a great day for democracy. sanctimonious james comey was his boss and made mccabe look like a choirboy. he knew all about the lies and corruption going on at the highest levels of the fbi!the fake news is beside themselves that mccabe was caught called out and fired. how many hundreds of thousands of dollars was given to wife’s campaign by crooked h friend terry m who was also under investigation? how many lies? how many leaks? comey knew it all and much more!the mueller probe should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime. it was based on fraudulent activities and a fake dossier paid for by crooked hillary and the dnc and improperly used in fisa court for surveillance of my campaign. witch hunt!wow watch comey lie under oath to senator g when asked “have you ever been an anonymous source...or known someone else to be an anonymous source...?” he said strongly “never no.” he lied as shown clearly on @foxandfriends.spent very little time with andrew mccabe but he never took notes when he was with me. i don’t believe he made memos except to help his own agenda probably at a later date. same with lying james comey. can we call them fake memos?why does the mueller team have 13 hardened democrats some big crooked hillary supporters and zero republicans? another dem recently added...does anyone think this is fair? and yet there is no collusion!a total witch hunt with massive conflicts of interest!the democrats do not want to help daca. would be so easy to make a deal!department of justice should have urged the supreme court to at least hear the drivers license case on illegal immigrants in arizona. i agree with @loudobbs. should have sought review.“special council is told to find crimes wether crimes exist or not. i was opposed the the selection of mueller to be special council i still am opposed to it. i think president trump was right when he said there never should have been a special council appointed because........there was no probable cause for believing that there was any crime collusion or otherwise or obstruction of justice!”  so stated by harvard law professor alan dershowitz.“special council is told to find crimes whether a crime exists or not. i was opposed to the selection of mueller to be special council. i am still opposed to it. i think president trump was right when he said there never should have been a special council appointed because.....i called president putin of russia to congratulate him on his election victory (in past obama called him also). the fake news media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate him. they are wrong! getting along with russia (and others) is a good thing not a bad thing............they can help solve problems with north korea syria ukraine isis iran and even the coming arms race. bush tried to get along but didn’t have the “smarts.” obama and clinton tried but didn’t have the energy or chemistry (remember reset). peace through strength!got $1.6 billion to start wall on southern border rest will be forthcoming. most importantly got $700 billion to rebuild our military $716 billion next year...most ever. had to waste money on dem giveaways in order to take care of military pay increase and new equipment.democrats refused to take care of daca. would have been so easy but they just didn’t care. i had to fight for military and start of wall.crazy joe biden is trying to act like a tough guy. actually he is weak both mentally and physically and yet he threatens me for the second time with physical assault. he doesn’t know me but he would go down fast and hard crying all the way. don’t threaten people joe!house intelligence committee votes to release final report. findings: (1) no evidence provided of collusion between trump campaign  russia. (2)  the obama administrations post election response was insufficient. (3) clapper provided inconsistent testimony on media contacts.daca was abandoned by the democrats. very unfair to them! would have been tied to desperately needed wall.i am considering a veto of the omnibus spending bill based on the fact that the 800000 plus daca recipients have been totally abandoned by the democrats (not even mentioned in bill) and the border wall which is desperately needed for our national defense is not fully funded.news conference at the white house concerning the omnibus spending bill.  1:00 p.m.obama administration legalized bump stocks. bad idea. as i promised today the department of justice will issue the rule banning bump stocks with a mandated comment period. we will ban all devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns.our thoughts and prayers are with the victims of the horrible attack in france yesterday and we grieve the nation’s loss. we also condemn the violent actions of the attacker and anyone who would provide him support. we are with you @emmanuelmacron!france honors a great hero. officer died after bravely swapping places with hostage in isis related terror attack. so much bravery around the world constantly fighting radical islamic terrorism. even stronger measures needed especially at borders!because of the $700  $716 billion dollars gotten to rebuild our military many jobs are created and our military is again rich. building a great border wall with drugs (poison) and enemy combatants pouring into our country is all about national defense. build wall through m!much can be done with the $1.6 billion given to building and fixing the border wall. it is just a down payment. work will start immediately. the rest of the money will come - and remember daca the democrats abandoned you (but we will not)!many lawyers and top law firms want to represent me in the russia case...don’t believe the fake news narrative that it is hard to find a lawyer who wants to take this on. fame  fortune will never be turned down by a lawyer though some are conflicted. problem is that a new..........lawyer or law firm will take months to get up to speed (if for no other reason than they can bill more) which is unfair to our great country - and i am very happy with my existing team. besides there was no collusion with russia except by crooked hillary and the dems!the economy is looking really good. it has been many years that we have seen these kind of numbers. the underlying strength of companies has perhaps never been better.so much fake news. never been more voluminous or more inaccurate. but through it all our country is doing great!trade talks going on with numerous countries that for many years have not treated the united states fairly. in the end all will be happy!the second amendment will never be repealed! as much as democrats would like to see this happen and despite the words yesterday of former supreme court justice stevens no way. we need more republicans in 2018 and must always hold the supreme court!for years and through many administrations everyone said that peace and the denuclearization of the korean peninsula was not even a small possibility. now there is a good chance that kim jong un will do what is right for his people and for humanity. look forward to our meeting!received message last night from xi jinping of china that his meeting with kim jong un went very well and that kim looks forward to his meeting with me. in the meantime and unfortunately maximum sanctions and pressure must be maintained at all cost!.@ustraderep just announced an agreement in principle with south korea on korus! a great deal for american and korean workers. let’s now focus on our important security relationship.my administration stands in solidarity with the brave citizens in orange county defending their rights against california\\'s illegal and unconstitutional sanctuary policies. california\\'s sanctuary laws........release known dangerous criminals into communities across the state. all citizens have the right to be protected by federal law and strong borders.....in the interim hon. robert wilkie of dod will serve as acting secretary. i am thankful for dr. david shulkin’s service to our country and to our great veterans!i have stated my concerns with amazon long before the election. unlike others they pay little or no taxes to state  local governments use our postal system as their delivery boy (causing tremendous loss to the u.s.) and are putting many thousands of retailers out of business!while we are on the subject it is reported that the u.s. post office will lose $1.50 on average for each package it delivers for amazon. that amounts to billions of dollars. the failing n.y. times reports that “the size of the company’s lobbying staff has ballooned” and that......does not include the fake washington post which is used as a “lobbyist” and should so  register. if the p.o. “increased its parcel rates amazon’s shipping costs would rise by $2.6 billion.” this post office scam must stop. amazon must pay real costs (and taxes) now!governor jerry “moonbeam” brown pardoned 5 criminal illegal aliens whose crimes include (1) kidnapping and robbery (2) badly beating wife and threatening a crime with intent to terrorize (3) dealing drugs. is this really what the great people of california want? @foxnewshappy easter!border patrol agents are not allowed to properly do their job at the border because of ridiculous liberal (democrat) laws like catch  release. getting more dangerous. “caravans” coming. republicans must go to nuclear option to pass tough laws now. no more daca deal!mexico is doing very little if not nothing at stopping people from flowing into mexico through their southern border and then into the u.s. they laugh at our dumb immigration laws. they must stop the big drug and people flows or i will stop their cash cow nafta. need wall!these big flows of people are all trying to take advantage of daca. they want in on the act!mexico has the absolute power not to let these large “caravans” of people enter their country. they must stop them at their northern border which they can do because their border laws work not allow them to pass through into our country which has no effective border laws........congress must immediately pass border legislation use nuclear option if necessary to stop the massive inflow of drugs and people. border patrol agents (and ice) are great but the weak dem laws don’t allow them to do their job. act now congress our country is being stolen!daca is dead because the democrats didn’t care or act and now everyone wants to get onto the daca bandwagon... no longer works. must build wall and secure our borders with proper border legislation. democrats want no borders hence drugs and crime!mexico is making a fortune on nafta...they have very strong border laws - ours are pathetic. with all of the money they make from the u.s. hopefully they will stop people from coming through their country and into ours at least until congress changes our immigration laws!so funny to watch fake news networks among the most dishonest groups of people i have ever dealt with criticize sinclair broadcasting for being biased. sinclair is far superior to cnn and even more fake nbc which is a total joke.only fools or worse are saying that our money losing post office makes money with amazon. they lose a fortune and this will be changed. also our fully tax paying retailers are closing stores all over the country...not a level playing field!so sad that the department of “justice” and the fbi are slow walking or even not giving the unredacted documents requested by congress. an embarrassment to our country!as ridiculous as it sounds the laws of our country do not easily allow us to send those crossing our southern border back where they came from. a whole big wasted procedure must take place. mexico  canada have tough immigration laws whereas ours are an obama joke. act congresshonduras mexico and many other countries that the u.s. is very generous to sends many of their people to our country through our weak immigration policies. caravans are heading here. must pass tough laws and build the wall. democrats allow open borders drugs and crime!39% of my nominations including diplomats to foreign lands have not been confirmed due to democrat obstruction and delay. at this rate it would take more than 7 years before i am allowed to have these great people start working. never happened before. disgraceful!the fake news networks those that knowingly have a sick and biased agenda are worried about the competition and quality of sinclair broadcast. the “fakers” at cnn nbc abc  cbs have done so much dishonest reporting that they should only be allowed to get awards for fiction!the big caravan of people from honduras now coming across mexico and heading to our “weak laws” border had better be stopped before it gets there. cash cow nafta is in play as is foreign aid to honduras and the countries that allow this to happen. congress must act now!check out the fact that you can’t get a job at ratings challenged @cnn unless you state that you are totally anti-trump? little jeff zuker whose job is in jeopardy is not having much fun lately. they should clean up and strengthen cnn and get back to honest reporting!thank you to rasmussen for the honest polling. just hit 50% which is higher than cheatin’ obama at the same time in his administration.i am right about amazon costing the united states post office massive amounts of money for being their delivery boy. amazon should pay these costs (plus) and not have them bourne by the american taxpayer. many billions of dollars. p.o. leaders don’t have a clue (or do they?)!was just briefed on the shooting at youtube’s hq in san bruno california. our thoughts and prayers are with everybody involved. thank you to our phenomenal law enforcement officers and first responders that are currently on the scene.our border laws are very weak while those of mexico  canada are very strong. congress must change these obama era and other laws now! the democrats stand in our way - they want people to pour into our country unchecked....crime! we will be taking strong action today.we are not in a trade war with china that war was lost many years ago by the foolish or incompetent people who represented the u.s. now we have a trade deficit of $500 billion a year with intellectual property theft of another $300 billion. we cannot let this continue!when you’re already $500 billion down you can’t lose!our thoughts and prayers are with the four u.s. marines from the 3rd marine aircraft wing who lost their lives in yesterday’s southern california helicopter crash. we pray for their families and our great @usmc.the caravan is largely broken up thanks to the strong immigration laws of mexico and their willingness to use them so as not to cause a giant scene at our border. because of the trump administrations actions border crossings are at a still unacceptable 46 year low. stop drugs!the fake news washington post amazon’s “chief lobbyist” has another (of many) phony headlines “trump defiant as china adds trade penalties.” wrong! should read “trump defiant as u.s. adds trade penalties will end barriers and massive  i.p. theft.” typically bad reporting!despite the aluminum tariffs aluminum prices are down 4%. people are surprised i’m not! lots of money coming into u.s. coffers and jobs jobs jobs!china which is a great economic power is considered a developing nation within the world trade organization. they therefore get tremendous perks and advantages especially over the u.s. does anybody think this is fair. we were badly represented. the wto is unfair to u.s.do you believe that the fake news media is pushing hard on a story that i am going to replace a.g. jeff sessions with epa chief scott pruitt who is doing a great job but is totally under siege? do people really believe this stuff? so much of the media is dishonest and corrupt!just spoke to @justintrudeau to pay my highest respect and condolences to the families of the terrible humboldt team tragedy. may god be with them all!we are sealing up our southern border. the people of our great country want safety and security. the dems have been a disaster on this very important issue!lawmakers of the house judiciary committee are angrily accusing the department of justice of missing the thursday deadline for turning over unredacted documents relating to fisa abuse fbi comey lynch mccabe clinton emails and much more. slow walking - what is going on? bad!what does the department of justice and fbi have to hide? why aren’t they giving the strongly requested documents (unredacted) to the house judiciary committee? stalling but for what reason? not looking good!fire at trump tower is out. very confined (well built building). firemen (and women) did a great job. thank you!while security spending was somewhat more than his predecessor scott pruitt has received death threats because of his bold actions at epa. record clean air  water while saving usa billions of dollars. rent was about market rate travel expenses ok. scott is doing a great job!“the fbi closed the case on hillary which was a rigged investigation. they exonerated her even before they ever interviewed her they never even put her under oath.....” and much more. so true jesse! @wattersworldthe washington post is far more fiction than fact. story after story is made up made garbage - more like a poorly written novel than good reporting. always quoting sources (not names) many of which don’t exist. story on john kelly isn’t true...just another hit job!the washington post is far more fiction than fact. story after

reciprocal  a deal will be made on intellectual property. great future for both countries!many dead including women and children in mindless chemical attack in syria. area of atrocity is in lockdown

new york times wrote another phony story. it was political pundit doug schoen not a ukrainian businessman who asked me to do a short speech by phone (skype) hosted by doug in ukraine. i was very positive about ukraine-another negative to the fake russia  c story!so much fake news about what is going on in the white house. very calm and calculated with a big focus on open and fair trade with china the coming north korea meeting and of course the vicious gas attack in syria. feels great to have bolton  larry k on board. i (we) are....doing things that nobody thought possible despite the never ending and corrupt russia investigation which takes tremendous time and focus. no collusion or obstruction (other than i fight back) so now they do the unthinkable and raid a lawyers office for information! bad!russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at syria. get ready russia  because they will be coming nice and new and “smart!” you shouldn’t be partners with a gas killing animal who kills his people and enjoys it!our relationship with russia is worse now than it has ever been and that includes the cold war. there is no reason for this. russia needs us to help with their economy something that would be very easy to do and we need all nations to work together. stop the arms race?much of the bad blood with russia is caused by the fake  corrupt russia investigation headed up by the all democrat loyalists or people that worked for obama. mueller is most conflicted of all (except rosenstein who signed fisa  comey letter). no collusion so they go crazy!speaker paul ryan is a truly good man and while he will not be seeking re-election he will leave a legacy of achievement that nobody can question. we are with you paul!big show tonight on @seanhannity! 9:00 p.m. on @foxnewsif i wanted to fire robert mueller in december as reported by the failing new york times i would have fired him. just more fake news from a biased newspaper!california governor jerry brown is doing the right thing and sending the national guard to the border. thank you jerry good move for the safety of our country!never said when an attack on syria would take place. could be very soon or not so soon at all! in any event the united states under my administration has done a great job of ridding the region of isis. where is our “thank you america?”i have agreed with the historically cooperative disciplined approach that we have engaged in with robert mueller (unlike the clintons!). i have full confidence in ty cobb my special counsel and have been fully advised throughout each phase of this process.would only join tpp if the deal were substantially better than the deal offered to pres. obama. we already have bilateral deals with six of the eleven nations in tpp and are working to make a deal with the biggest of those  nations japan who has hit us hard on trade for years!tremendous pressure is building like never before for the border wall and an end to crime cradling sanctuary cities. started the wall in san diego where the people were pushing really hard to get it. they will soon be protected!james comey is a proven leaker  liar. virtually everyone in washington thought he should be fired for the terrible job he did-until he was in fact fired. he leaked classified information for which he should be prosecuted. he lied to congress under oath. he is a weak and.........untruthful slime ball who was as time has proven a terrible director of the fbi. his handling of the crooked hillary clinton case and the events surrounding it will go down as one of the worst “botch jobs” of history. it was my great honor to fire james comey!doj just issued the mccabe report - which is a total disaster. he lied! lied! lied! mccabe was totally controlled by comey - mccabe is comey!! no collusion all made up by this den of thieves and lowlifes!a perfectly executed strike last night. thank you to france and the united kingdom for their wisdom and the power of their fine military. could not have had a better result. mission accomplished!so proud of our great military which will soon be after the spending of billions of fully approved dollars the finest that our country has ever had. there won’t be anything or anyone even close!unbelievably james comey states that polls where crooked hillary was leading were a factor in the handling (stupidly) of the clinton email probe. in other words he was making decisions based on the fact that he thought she was going to win and he wanted a job. slimeball!the big questions in comey’s badly reviewed book aren’t answered like how come he gave up classified information (jail) why did he lie to congress (jail) why did the dnc refuse to give server to the fbi (why didn’t they take it) why the phony memos mccabe’s $700000  more?comey throws ag lynch “under the bus!” why can’t we all find out what happened on the tarmac in the back of the plane with wild bill and lynch? was she promised a supreme court seat or ag in order to lay off hillary. no golf and grandkids talk (give us all a break)!the syrian raid was so perfectly carried out with such precision that the only way the fake news media could demean was by my use of the term “mission accomplished.” i knew they would seize on this but felt it is such a great military term it should be brought back. use often!i never asked comey for personal loyalty. i hardly even knew this guy. just another of his many lies. his “memos” are self serving and fake!attorney client privilege is now a thing of the past. i have many (too many!) lawyers and they are probably wondering when their offices and even homes are going to be raided with everything including their phones and computers taken. all lawyers are deflated and concerned!slippery james comey a man who always ends up badly and out of whack (he is not smart!) will go down as the worst fbi director in history by far!just hit 50% in the rasmussen poll much higher than president obama at same point. with all of the phony stories and fake news it’s hard to believe! thank you america we are doing great things.comey drafted the crooked hillary exoneration long before he talked to her (lied in congress to senator g) then based his decisions on her poll numbers. disgruntled he mccabe and the others committed many crimes!russia and china are playing the currency devaluation game as the u.s. keeps raising interest rates. not acceptable!employment is up taxes are down. enjoy!i am in florida and looking forward to my meeting with prime minister abe of japan. working on trade and military security.looks like jerry brown and california are not looking for safety and security along their very porous border. he cannot come to terms for the national guard to patrol and protect the border. the high crime rate will only get higher. much wanted wall in san diego already started!so many people are seeing the benefits of the tax cut bill. everyone is talking really nice to see!getting ready to meet prime minister abe of japan a truly fine gentleman!rasmussen just came out at 51% approval despite the fake news media. they were one of the three most accurate on election day. just about the most inaccurate were cnn and abc news/washington post and they haven’t changed (get new pollsters). much of the media is a scam!today’s court decision means that congress must close loopholes that block the removal of dangerous criminal aliens including aggravated felons. this is a public safety crisis that can only be fixed by........congress – house and senate must quickly pass a legislative fix to ensure violent criminal aliens can be removed from our society. keep america safe!states and cities throughout our country are being cheated and treated so badly by online retailers. very unfair to traditional tax paying stores!while japan and south korea would like us to go back into tpp i don’t like the deal for the united states. too many contingencies and no way to get out if it doesn’t work. bilateral deals are far more efficient profitable and better for our workers. look how bad wto is to u.s.there is a revolution going on in california. soooo many sanctuary areas want out of this ridiculous crime infested  breeding concept. jerry brown is trying to back out of the national guard at the border but the people of the state are not happy. want security  safety now!mike pompeo met with kim jong un in north korea last week. meeting went very smoothly and a good relationship was formed. details of summit are being worked out now. denuclearization will be a great thing for world but also for north korea!slippery james comey the worst fbi director in history was not fired because of the phony russia investigation where by the way there was no collusion (except by the dems)!best wishes to prime minister @netanyahu and all of the people of israel on the 70th anniversary of your great independence. we have no better friends anywhere. looking forward to moving our embassy to jerusalem next month!great meeting with prime minister abe of japan who has just left florida. talked in depth about north korea military and trade. good things will happen!thank you san diego county for defending the rule of law and supporting our lawsuit against california\\'s illegal and unconstitutional \\'sanctuary\\' policies. california\\'s dangerous policies release violent criminals back into our communities putting all americans at risk.governor jerry brown announced he will deploy “up to 400 national guard troops” to do nothing. the crime rate in california is high enough and the federal government will not be paying for governor brown’s charade. we need border security and action not words!.@marshablackburn is a wonderful woman who has always been there when we have needed her. great on the military border security and crime. loves and works hard for the people of tennessee. she has my full endorsement and i will be there to campaign with her!democrats are obstructing good (hopefully great) people wanting to give up a big portion of their life to work for our government hence the american people. they are “slow walking” all of my nominations - hundreds of people. at this rate it would take 9 years for all approvals!...hopefully the senate will not leave washington until our ambassadors judges and the people who make washington work are approved. the democrats are obstructing the process and we need these people approved for the good of our country!mike pompeo is outstanding. first in his class at west point. a top student at harvard law school. a success at whatever he has done. we need the senate to approve mike asap. he will be a great secretary of state!my thoughts prayers and condolences are with the families friends and colleagues of the two @gcsoflorida deputies (heroes) who lost their lives in the line of duty today.sanctuary cities released at least 142 gang members across the united states making it easy for them to commit all forms of violent crimes where none would have existed. we are doing a great job of law enforcement but things such as this make safety in america difficult!james comey just threw andrew mccabe “under the bus.” inspector general’s report on mccabe is a disaster for both of them! getting a little (lot) of their own medicine?james comey memos just out and show clearly that there was no collusion and no obstruction. also he leaked classified information. wow! will the witch hunt continue?so general michael flynn’s life can be totally destroyed while shadey james comey can leak and lie and make lots of money from a third rate book (that should never have been written). is that really the way life in america is supposed to work? i don’t think so!so exciting! i have agreed to be the commencement speaker at our great naval academy on may 25th in annapolis maryland. looking forward to being there.nancy pelosi is going absolutely crazy about the big tax cuts given to the american people by the republicans...got not one democrat vote! here’s a choice. they want to end them and raise your taxes substantially. republicans are working on making them permanent and more cuts!looks like opec is at it again. with record amounts of oil all over the place including the fully loaded ships at sea oil prices are artificially very high! no good and will not be accepted!can you believe that despite 93% bad stories from the fake news media (should be getting good stories) today we had just about our highest poll numbers including those on election day? the american public is wise to the phony an dishonest press. make america great again!just heard the campaign was sued by the obstructionist democrats. this can be good news in that we will now counter for the dnc server that they refused to give to the fbi the wendy wasserman schultz servers and documents held by the pakistani mystery man and clinton emails.north korea has agreed to suspend all nuclear tests and close up a major test site. this is very good news for north korea and the world - big progress! look forward to our summit.just heard the campaign was sued by the obstructionist democrats. this can be good news in that we will now counter for the dnc server that they refused to give to the fbi the debbie wasserman schultz servers and documents held by the pakistani mystery man and clinton emails.james comey illegally leaked classified documents to the press in order to generate a special council? therefore the special council was established based on an illegal act? really does everybody know what that means?a message from kim jong un: “north korea will stop nuclear tests and launches of intercontinental ballistic missiles.”also will “shut down a nuclear test site in the country’s northern side to prove the vow to suspend nuclear tests.” progress being made for all!the new york times and a third rate reporter named maggie habberman known as a crooked h flunkie who i don’t speak to and have nothing to do with are going out of their way to destroy michael cohen and his relationship with me in the hope that he will “flip.” they use........non-existent “sources” and a drunk/drugged up loser who hates michael a fine person with a wonderful family. michael is a businessman for his own account/lawyer who i have always liked  respected. most people will flip if the government lets them out of trouble even if........it means lying or making up stories. sorry i don’t see michael doing that despite the horrible witch hunt and the dishonest media!the new

don’t see michael doing that despite the horrible witch hunt and the dishonest media!heading to the southern white house to watch the funeral service of barbara bush. first lady melania has arrived in houston to pay our respects. will be a beautiful day!so funny the democrats have sued the republicans for winning. now he r’s counter and force them to turn over a treasure trove of material including servers and emails!sylvester stallone called me with the story of heavyweight boxing champion jack johnson. his trials and tribulations were great his life complex and controversial. others have looked at this over the years most thought it would be done but yes i am considering a full pardon!james comey’s memos are classified i did not declassify them. they belong to our government! therefore he broke the law! additionally he totally made up many of the things he said i said and he is already a proven liar and leaker. where are memos on clinton lynch  others?the washington post said i refer to jeff sessions as “mr. magoo” and rod rosenstein as “mr. peepers.” this is “according to people with whom the president has spoken.” there are no such people and don’t know these characters...just more fake  disgusting news to create ill will!“at least two memos comey shared with a friend contained classified information.”  wall street journal“gop lawmakers asking sessions to investigate comey and hillary clinton.” @foxnews   good luck with that request!sleepy eyes chuck todd of fake news nbc just stated that we have given up so much in our negotiations with north korea and they have given up nothing. wow we haven’t given up anything  they have agreed to denuclearization (so great for world) site closure  no more testing!....we are a long way from conclusion on north korea maybe things will work out and maybe they won’t - only time will tell....but the work i am doing now should have been done a long time ago!“i can die happy now with trump job performance” stated mary matalin. “a great overall president stunning!” thank you mary.a complete witch hunt!funny how all of the pundits that couldn’t come close to making a deal on north korea are now all over the place telling me how to make a deal!kim strassel of the wsj just said after reviewing the dumb comey memos “you got to ask what was the purpose of the special counsel? there’s no there there.” dan henninger of the wsj said memos would show that this would be one of the weakest obstruction cases ever brought!hard to believe obstructionists may vote against mike pompeo for secretary of state. the dems will not approve hundreds of good people including the ambassador to germany. they are maxing out the time on approval process for all never happened before. need more republicans!despite the democrat inspired laws on sanctuary cities and the border being so bad and one sided i have instructed the secretary of homeland security not to let these large caravans of people into our country. it is a disgrace. we are the only country in the world so naive! wallmexico whose laws on immigration are very tough must stop people from going through mexico and into the u.s. we may make this a condition of the new nafta agreement. our country cannot accept what is happening! also we must get wall funding fast.here’s a great stat - since january 2017 the number of people forced to use food

melania did.looking forward to my meeting with tim cook of apple. we will be talking about many things including how the u.s. has been treated unfairly for many years by many countries on trade.i will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 8:00 a.m. enjoy!the u.s. has put together a strong bid w/ canada  mexico for the 2026 world cup. it would be a shame if countries that we always support were to lobby against the u.s. bid. why should we be supporting these countries when they don’t support us (including at the united nations)?is everybody believing what is going on. james comey can’t define what a leak is. he illegally leaked classified information but doesn’t understand what he did or how serious it is. he lied all over the place to cover it up. he’s either very sick or very dumb. remember sailor!after a furious year of missile launches and nuclear testing a historic meeting between north and south korea is now taking place. good things are happening but only time will tell!korean war to end! the united states and all of its great people should be very proud of what is now taking place in korea!so great to have staff sgt. dan nevins and the incredible wounded warriors with me in the white house yesterday. these are truly brave and special people! @foxandfriendsplease do not forget the great help that my good friend president xi of china has given to the

history).look forward to meeting with chancellor angela merkel of germany today. so much to discuss so little time! it will be good for both of our great countries!just out: house intelligence committee report released. “no evidence” that the trump campaign “colluded coordinated or conspired with russia.” clinton campaign paid for opposition research obtained from russia- wow! a total witch hunt! must end now!house intelligence committee rules that there was no collusion between the trump campaign and russia. as i have been saying all along it is all a big hoax by the democrats based on payments and lies. there should never have been a special councel appointed. witch hunt!house intelligence committee rules that there was no collusion between the trump campaign and russia. as i have been saying all along it is all a big hoax by the democrats based on payments and lies. there should never have been a special counsel appointed. witch hunt!allegations made by senator jon tester against admiral/doctor ron jackson are proving false. the secret service is unable to confirm (in fact they deny) any of the phony democrat charges which have absolutely devastated the wonderful jackson family. tester should resign. the.........great people of montana will not stand for this kind of slander when talking of a great human being. admiral jackson is the kind of man that those in montana would most respect and admire and now for no reason whatsoever his reputation has been shattered. not fair tester!“clapper lied about (fraudulent) dossier leaks to cnn” @foxandfriends foxnews  he is a lying machine who now works for fake news cnn.just had a long and very good talk with president moon of south korea. things are going very well time and location of meeting with north korea is being set. also spoke to prime minister abe of japan to inform him of the ongoing negotiations.look forward to being in the great state of michigan tonight. major business expansion and jobs pouring into your state. auto companies expanding at record pace. big crowd tonight will be live on t.v.secret service has just informed me that senator jon tester’s statements on admiral jackson are not true. there were no such findings. a horrible thing that we in d.c. must live with just like phony russian collusion. tester should lose race in montana. very dishonest and sick!while washington michigan was a big success washington d.c. just didn’t work. everyone is talking about the fact that the white house correspondents dinner was a very big boring bust...the so-called comedian really “bombed.” @greggutfeld should host next year! @petehegsethjust got recent poll - much higher than president o at same time....well much more has been accomplished!“trump’s triumphs are driving his critics crazy!” thank you steve hilton @nextrevfnc just want to do what is right for our wonderful u.s.a.the white house correspondents’ dinner was a failure last year but this year was an embarrassment to everyone associated with it. the filthy “comedian” totally bombed (couldn’t even deliver her lines-much like the seth meyers weak performance). put dinner to rest or start over!headline: “kim prepared to cede nuclear weapons if u.s. pledges not to invade” - from the failing new york times. also will shut down nuclear test site in may.the white house correspondents’ dinner is dead as we know it. this was a total disaster and an embarrassment to our great country and all that it stands for. fake news is alive and well and beautifully represented on saturday night!numerous countries are being considered for the meeting but would peace house/freedom house on the border of north  south korea be a more representative important and lasting site than a third party country? just asking!i recently had a terrific meeting with a bipartisan group of freshman lawmakers who feel very strongly in favor of congressional term limits. i gave them my full support and endorsement for their efforts. #draintheswampthe migrant ‘caravan’ that is openly defying our border shows how weak  ineffective u.s. immigration laws are. yet democrats like jon tester continue to support the open borders agenda – tester even voted to protect sanctuary cities. we need lawmakers who will put america first.during small business week we celebrate the great hard-working entrepreneurs across our country who have started and operate a small business!the fake news is going crazy making up false stories and using only unnamed sources (who don’t exist). they are totally unhinged and the great success of this administration is making them do and say things that even they can’t believe they are saying. truly bad people!the white house is running very smoothly despite phony witch hunts etc. there is great energy and unending stamina both necessary to get things done. we are accomplishing the unthinkable and setting positive records while doing so! fake news is going “bonkers!”so disgraceful that the questions concerning the russian witch hunt were “leaked” to the media. no questions on collusion. oh i see...you have a made up phony crime collusion that never existed and an investigation begun with illegally leaked classified information. nice!delegation heading to china to begin talks on the massive trade deficit that has been created with our country. very much like north korea this should have been fixed years ago not now. same with other countries and nafta...but it will all get done. great potential for usa!it would seem very hard to obstruct justice for a crime that never happened! witch hunt!there was no collusion (it is a hoax) and there is no obstruction of justice (that is a setup  trap). what there is is negotiations going on with north korea over nuclear war negotiations going on with china over trade deficits negotiations on nafta and much more. witch hunt!“the questions are an intrusion into the president’s article 2  powers under the constitution to fire any executive branch employee...what the president was thinking is an outrageous.....as to the president’s unfettered power to fire anyone...” joe digenova former us attorneynew book - a must read! “the russia hoax - the illicit scheme to clear hillary clinton and frame donald trump” by the brilliant fox news legal analyst gregg jarrett. a sad chapter for law enforcement. a rigged system!a rigged system - they don’t want to turn over documents to congress. what are they afraid of? why so much redacting? why such unequal “justice?” at some point i will have no choice but to use the powers granted to the presidency and get involved!“this isn’t some game. you are screwing with the work of the president of the united states.”  john dowd march 2018.  with north korea china the middle east and so much more there is not much time to be thinking about this especially since there was no russian “collusion.”as everybody is aware the past administration has long been asking for three hostages to be released from a north korean labor camp but to no avail. stay tuned!ainsley earnhardt a truly great person just wrote a wonderful book “the light within me” which is doing really well. she is very special and so is her new book...bring it to number one!our great financial team is in china trying to negotiate a level playing field on trade! i look forward to being with president xi in the not too distant future. we will always have a good (great) relationship!mr. cohen an attorney received a monthly retainer not from the campaign and having nothing to do with the campaign from which he entered into through reimbursement a private contract between two parties known as a non-disclosure agreement or nda. these agreements are........very common among celebrities and people of wealth. in this case it is in full force and effect and will be used in arbitration for damages against ms. clifford (daniels). the agreement was used to stop the false and extortionist accusations made by her about an affair.........despite already having signed a detailed letter admitting that there was no affair. prior to its violation by ms. clifford and her attorney this was a private agreement. money from the campaign or campaign contributions played no roll in this transaction.this spring marks 4yrs since the phoenix va crisis. we won\\'t forget what happened to our great vets. choice is vital but the program needs work  is running out of $. congress must fix choice program by memorial day so vets can get the care they deserve. i will sign immediately!our southern border is under siege. congress must act now to change our weak and ineffective immigration laws. must build a wall. mexico which has a massive crime problem is

with the apprentice is now as bad as fake news cnn. sad!just out: 3.9% unemployment. 4% is broken! in the meantime witch hunt!democrats and liberals in congress want to disarm law-abiding americans at the same time they are releasing dangerous criminal aliens and savage gang members onto our streets. politicians who put criminal aliens before american citizens should be voted out of office!we are going to demand congress secure the border in the upcoming cr. illegal immigration must end!great book just out by very successful businessman @andypuzder. always known as somebody who knows how to win “capitalist comeback” will be a big hit!our high level delegation is on the way back from china where they had long meetings with chinese leaders and business representatives. we will be meeting

keep making a big difference. problem is don blankenship currently running for senate can’t win the general election in your state...no way! remember alabama. vote rep. jenkins or a.g. morrisey!my highly respected nominee for cia director gina haspel has come under fire because she was too tough on terrorists. think of that in these very dangerous times we have the most qualified person a woman who democrats want out because she is too tough on terror. win gina!the russia witch hunt is rapidly losing credibility. house intelligence committee found no collusion coordination or anything else with russia. so now the probe says ok what else is there? how about obstruction for a made up phony crime.there is no o it’s called fighting backthe 13 angry democrats in charge of the russian witch hunt are starting to find out that there is a court system in place that actually protects people from injustice...and just wait ‘till the courts get to see your unrevealed conflicts of interest!“the great revolt” by salena zito and brad todd does much to tell the story of our great election victory. the forgotten men  women are forgotten no longer!good luck to ric grenell our new ambassador to

wrongfully impacts the mid-term elections which is what the democrats always intended? republicans better get tough and smart before it is too late!the united states does not need john kerry’s

your country!the republican party had a great night. tremendous voter energy and excitement and all candidates are those who have a great chance of winning in november. the economy is sooo strong and with nancy pelosi wanting to end the big tax cuts and raise taxes why wouldn’t we win?the fake news is working overtime. just reported that despite the tremendous success we are having with the economy  all things else 91% of the network news about me is negative (fake). why do we work so hard in working with the media when it is corrupt? take away credentials?candace owens of turning point

12th. we will both try to make it a very special moment for world peace!big week next week when the american embassy in israel will be moved to jerusalem. congratulations to all!why doesn’t the fake news media state that the trump administration’s anti-trust division has been and is opposed to the att purchase of time warner in a currently ongoing trial. such a disgrace in reporting!north korea has announced that they will dismantle nuclear test site this month ahead of the big summit meeting on june 12th. thank you a very smart and gracious gesture!iran’s military budget is up more than 40% since the obama negotiated nuclear deal was reached...just another indicator that it was all a big lie. but not anymore!the senate should get funding done before the august break or not go home. wall and border security should be included. also waiting for approval of almost 300 nominations worst in history. democrats are doing everything possible to obstruct all they know how to do. stay!president xi of china and i are working together to give massive chinese phone company zte a way to get back into business fast. too many jobs in china lost. commerce department has been instructed to get it done!china and the united states are working well together on trade but past negotiations have been so one sided in favor of china for so many years that it is hard for them to make a deal that benefits both countries. but be cool it will all work out!remember how badly iran was behaving with the iran deal in place. they were trying to take over the middle east by whatever means necessary. now that will not happen!so sad to see the terror attack in paris. at some point countries will have to open their eyes  see what is really going on. this kind of sickness  hatred is not compatible with a loving peaceful  successful country! changes to our thought process on terror must be made.zte the large chinese phone company buys a big percentage of individual parts from u.s. companies. this is also reflective of the larger trade deal we are negotiating with china and my personal relationship with president xi.the so-called leaks coming out of the white house are a massive over  exaggeration put out by the fake news media in order to make us look as bad as possible. with that being said leakers are traitors and cowards and we will find out who they are!heading over to walter reed medical center to see our great first lady melania. successful procedure she is in good spirits. thank you to all of the well-wishers!our great first lady is doing really well. will be leaving hospital in 2 or 3 days. thank you for so much love and support!trade negotiations are continuing with china. they have been making hundreds of billions of dollars a year from the u.s. for many years. stay tuned!can you believe that with all of the made up unsourced stories i get from the fake news media together with the  $10000000 russian witch hunt (there is no collusion) i now have my best poll numbers in a year. much of the media may be corrupt but the people truly get it!congratulations to deb fischer. the people of nebraska have seen what a great job she is doing - and it showed up at the ballot box! #magathe washington post and cnn have typically written false stories about our trade negotiations with china. nothing has happened with zte except as it pertains to the larger trade deal. our country has been losing hundreds of billions of dollars a year with china......we have not seen china’s demands yet which should be few in that previous u.s. administrations have done so poorly in negotiating. china has seen our demands. there has been no folding as the media would love people to believe the meetings......haven’t even started yet! the u.s. has very little to give because it has given so much over the years. china has much to give!lou barletta will be a great senator for pennsylvania but his opponent bob casey has been a do-nothing senator who only shows up at election time. he votes along the nancy pelosi elizabeth warren lines loves sanctuary cities bad and expensive healthcare......and voted against the massive tax cut bill. he’s also weak on borders and crime. sadly our great military and vets mean nothing to bobby jr. lou barletta will win! #magagina haspel is one step closer to leading our brave men and women at the cia. she is exceptionally qualified and the senate should confirm her immediately. we need her to keep our great country safe! #confirmginacongratulations america we are now into the second year of the greatest witch hunt in american history...and there is still no collusion and no obstruction. the only collusion was that done by democrats who were unable to win an election despite the spending of far more money!wow word seems to be coming out that the obama fbi “spied on the trump campaign with an imbedded informant.” andrew mccarthy says “there’s probably no doubt that they had at least one confidential informant in the campaign.” if so this is bigger than watergate!wow word seems to be coming out that the obama fbi “spied on the trump campaign with an embedded informant.” andrew mccarthy says “there’s probably no doubt that they had at least one confidential informant in the campaign.” if so this is bigger than watergate!despite the disgusting illegal and unwarranted witch hunt we have had the most successful first 17 month administration in u.s. history - by far! sorry to the fake news media and “haters” but that’s the way it is!congrats to the house for passing the va mission act yesterday. without this funding our veterans will be forced to stand in never ending lines in order to receive care. putting politics over our veterans care is unacceptable – senate must vote yes on this bill by memorial day!great talk with my friend president mauricio macri of argentina this week. he is doing such a good job for argentina. i support his vision for transforming his country’s economy and unleashing its potential!tomorrow the house will vote on a strong farm bill which includes work requirements. we must support our nation’s great farmers!“apparently the doj put a spy in the trump campaign. this has never been done before and by any means necessary they are out to frame donald trump for crimes he didn’t commit.”  david asman  @loudobbs @greggjarrett   really bad stuff!fake news media had me calling immigrants or illegal immigrants “animals.” wrong! they were begrudgingly forced to withdraw their stories. i referred to ms 13 gang members as “animals” a big difference - and so true. fake news got it purposely wrong as usual!why isn’t disgraced fbi official andrew mccabe being investigated for the $700000 crooked hillary democrats in virginia led by clinton best friend terry m (under fbi investigation that they killed) gave to mccabe’s wife in her run for office? then dropped case on clinton!reports are there was indeed at least one fbi representative implanted for political purposes into my campaign for president. it took place very early on and long before the phony russia hoax became a “hot” fake news story. if true - all time biggest political scandal!school shooting in texas. early reports not looking good. god bless all!california finally deserves a great governor one who understands borders crime and lowering taxes. john cox is the man - he’ll be the best governor you’ve ever had. i fully endorse john cox for governor and look forward to working with him to make california great again!america is blessed with extraordinary energy abundance including more than 250 years worth of beautiful clean coal. we have ended the war on coal and will continue to work to promote american energy dominance!great to have our incredible first lady back home in the white house. melanie is feeling and doing really well. thank you for all of your prayers and best wishes!great to have our incredible first lady back home in the white house. melania is feeling and doing really well. thank you for all of your prayers and best wishes!if the fbi or doj was infiltrating a campaign for the benefit of another campaign that is a really big deal. only the release or review of documents that the house intelligence committee (also senate judiciary) is asking for can give the conclusive answers. drain the swamp!things are really getting ridiculous. the failing and crooked (but not as crooked as hillary clinton) @nytimes has done a long  boring story indicating that the world’s most expensive witch hunt has found nothing on russia  me so now they are looking at the rest of the world!....at what point does this soon to be $20000000 witch hunt composed of 13 angry and heavily conflicted democrats and two people who have worked for obama for 8 years stop! they have found no collussion with russia no obstruction but they aren’t looking at the corruption......in the hillary clinton campaign where she deleted 33000 emails got $145000000 while secretary of state paid mccabes wife $700000 (and got off the fbi hook along with terry m) and so much more. republicans and real americans should start getting tough on this scam.now that the witch hunt has given up on russia and is looking at the rest of the world they should easily be able to take it into the mid-term elections where they can put some hurt on the republican party. don’t worry about dems fisa abuse missing emails or fraudulent dossier!what ever happened to the server at the center of so much corruption that the democratic national committee refused to hand over to the hard charging (except in the case of democrats) fbi? they broke into homes  offices early in the morning but were afraid to take the server?....and why hasn’t the podesta brother been charged and arrested like others after being forced to close down his very large and successful firm? is it because he is a very well connected democrat working in the swamp of washington d.c.?the witch hunt finds no collusion with russia - so now they’re looking at the rest of the world. oh’ great!i hereby demand and will do so officially tomorrow that the department of justice look into whether or not the fbi/doj infiltrated or surveilled the trump campaign for political purposes - and if any such demands or requests were made by people within the obama administration!china has agreed to buy massive amounts of additional farm/agricultural products - would be one of the best things to happen to our farmers in many years!on china barriers and tariffs to come down for first time.china must continue to be strong  tight on the border of north korea until a deal is made. the word is that recently the border has become much more porous and more has been filtering in. i want this to happen and north korea to be very successful but only after signing!....top of the fbi. brennan started this entire debacle about president trump. we now know that brennan had detailed knowledge of the (phony) dossier...he knows about the dossier he denies knowledge of the dossier he briefs the gang of 8 on the hill about the dossier which.......they then used to start an investigation about trump. it is that simple. this guy is the genesis of this whole debacle. this was a political hit job this was not an intelligence investigation. brennan has disgraced himself he’s worried about staying out of jail.” dan bonginothe wall street journal asks “where in the world was barack obama?”  a very good question!.@asahutchinson the great governor of arkansas is in a primary tomorrow. he has done an incredible job with a focus on lower taxes border security and crime prevention. asa loves our military and our veterans. i fully endorse asa for governor!if the person placed very early into my campaign wasn’t a spy put there by the previous administration for political purposes how come such a seemingly massive amount of money was paid for services rendered - many times higher than normal......follow the money! the spy was there early in the campaign and yet never reported collusion with russia because there was no collusion. he was only there to spy for political reasons and to help crooked hillary win - just like they did to bernie sanders who got duped!@foxandfriends  “new bombshell in the obama spying scandal. did other agencies spy on trump campaign?” even clapper worlds dumbest former intelligence head who has the problem of lying a lot used the word spy when describing the illegal activities!“it’s clear that they had eyes and ears all over the trump campaign” judge andrew napolitanospygate could be one of the biggest political scandals in history!everybody is with tomi lahren a truly outstanding and respected young woman! @foxandfriends“trump should be happy that the fbi was spying on his campaign” no james clapper i am not happy. spying on a campaign would be illegal and a scandal to boot!our trade deal with china is moving along nicely but in the end we will probably have to use a different structure in that this will be too hard to get done and to verify results after completion.big legislation will be signed by me shortly. after many years right to try and big changes to dodd frank.there will be big news coming soon for our great american autoworkers. after many decades of losing your jobs to other countries you have waited long enough!witch hunt!will be interviewed on @foxandfriends tomorrow morning at 6:00 a.m. enjoy!clapper has now admitted that there was spying in my campaign. large dollars were paid to the spy far beyond normal. starting to look like one of the biggest political scandals in u.s. history. spygate - a terrible thing!not surprisingly the great men  women of the fbi are starting to speak out against comey mccabe and all of the political corruption and poor leadership found within the top ranks of the fbi. comey was a terrible and corrupt leader who inflicted great pain on the fbi! #spygatei will be making the commencment address today at the united states naval academy in annapolis maryland. look forward to being with some of the greatest people on earth!the democrats are now alluding to the the concept that having an informant placed in an opposing party’s campaign is different than having a spy as illegal as that may be. but what about an “informant” who is paid a fortune and who “sets up” way earlier than the russian hoax?can anyone even imagine having spies placed in a competing campaign by the people and party in absolute power for the sole purpose of political advantage and gain? and to think that the party in question even with the expenditure of far more money lost!“everyone knows there was a spy and in fact the people who were involved in the spying are admitting that there was a spy...widespread spying involving multiple people.” mollie hemingway the federalist senior editor  but the corrupt mainstream media hates this monster story!democrats are so obviously rooting against us in our negotiations with north korea. just like they are coming to the defense of ms 13 thugs saying that they are individuals  must be nurtured or asking to end your big tax cuts  raise your taxes instead. dems have lost touch!very good news to receive the warm and productive statement from north korea. we will soon see where it will lead hopefully to long and enduring prosperity and peace. only time (and talent) will tell!to the @navalacademy class of 2018 i say: we know you are up to the task. we know you will make us proud. we know that glory will be yours. because you are winners you are warriors you are fighters you are champions and you will lead us to victory! god bless the u.s.a.!  police have every right to legally protest against the mayor and an administration that just won’t let them do their job. the killings are at a record pace and tough police work which chicago will not allow would bring things back to order fast...the killings must stop!funny to watch the democrats criticize trade deals being negotiated by me when they don’t even know what the deals are and when for 8 years the obama administration did nothing on trade except let other countries rip off the united states. lost almost $800 billion/year under “o”senator schumer and obama administration let phone company zte flourish with no security checks. i closed it down then let it reopen with high level security guarantees change of management and board must purchase u.s. parts and pay a $1.3 billion fine. dems do nothing.......but complain and obstruct. they made only bad deals (iran) and their so-called trade deals are the laughing stock of the world!we are having very productive talks with north korea about reinstating the summit which if it does happen will likely remain in singapore on the same date june 12th. and if necessary will be extended beyond that date.good news about the release of the american hostage from venezuela. should be landing in d.c. this evening and be in the white house with his family at about 7:00 p.m. the great people of utah will be very happy!put pressure on the democrats to end the horrible law that separates children from there parents once they cross the border into the u.s. catch and release lottery and chain must also go with it and we must continue building the wall! democrats are protecting ms-13 thugs.thanks to very brave teacher  hero jason seaman of noblesville indiana for his heroic act in saving so many precious young lives. his quick and automatic action is being talked about all over the world!unlike what the failing and corrupt new york times would like people to believe there is zero disagreement within the trump administration as to  how to deal with north korea...and if there was it wouldn’t matter. the @nytimes has called me wrong right from the beginning!the failing @nytimes quotes “a senior white house official” who doesn’t exist as saying “even if the meeting were reinstated holding it on june 12 would be impossible given the lack of time and the amount of planning needed.” wrong again! use real people not phony sources.with spies or “informants” as the democrats like to call them because it sounds less sinister (but it’s not) all over my campaign even from a very early date why didn’t the crooked highest levels of the fbi or “justice” contact me to tell me of the  phony russia problem?this whole russia probe is rigged. just an excuse as to why the dems and crooked hillary lost the election and states that haven’t been lost in decades. 13 angry democrats and all dems if you include the people who worked for obama for 8 years. #spygate  conflicts of interest!who’s going to give back the young and beautiful lives (and others) that have been devastated and destroyed by the phony russia collusion witch hunt? they journeyed down to washington d.c. with stars in their eyes and wanting to help our nation...they went back home in tatters!fantastic to have 400000 great men  women of rolling thunder in d.c. showing their patriotism. they love our country they love our flag they stand for our national anthem! thanks to executive director artie muller.why didn’t the 13 angry democrats investigate the campaign of crooked hillary clinton many crimes much collusion with russia? why didn’t the fbi take the server from the dnc?  rigged investigation!our united states team has arrived in north korea to make arrangements for the summit between kim jong un and myself. i truly believe north korea has brilliant potential and will be a great economic and financial nation one day. kim jong un agrees with me on this. it will happen!why didn’t president obama do something about the so-called russian meddling when he was told about it by the fbi before the election? because he thought crooked hillary was going to win and he didn’t want to upset the apple cart! he was in charge not me and did nothing.happy memorial day! those who died for our great country would be very happy and proud at how well our country is doing today. best economy in decades lowest unemployment numbers for blacks and hispanics ever ( women in 18years) rebuilding our military and so much more. nice!“the president deserves some answers.” @foxnews in discussing “spygate.”“sally yates is part of concerns people have raised about bias in the justice dept. i find her actions to be really quite unbelievable.” jonathan turley“we now find out that the obama administration put the opposing campaigns presidential candidate or his campaign under investigation. that raises legitimate questions. i just find this really odd...this goes to the heart of our electoral system.” jonathan turley on @foxnewsa democratic lawmaker just introduced a bill to repeal the gop tax cuts (no chance). this is too good to be true for republicans...remember the nancy pelosi dems are also weak on crime the border and want to be gentle and kind to ms-13 gang members...not good!california has a rare opportunity to turn things around and solve its high crime high tax problems - along with so many others. on june 5th. vote for gop gubernatorial candidate john cox a really good and highly competent man. he’ll make california great again!democrats mistakenly tweet 2014 pictures from obama’s term showing children from the border in steel cages. they thought it was recent pictures in order to make us look bad but backfires. dems must agree to wall and new border protection for good of country...bipartisan bill!we have put a great team together for our talks with north korea. meetings are currently taking place concerning summit and more. kim young chol the vice chairman of north korea heading now to new york. solid response to my letter thank you!“this investigation involved far more surveillance than we ever had any idea about. it wasn’t just a wiretap against a campaign aide...it was secretly gathering information on the trump campaign...people call that spying...this is unprecedented and  scandalous.” mollie hemingwaythe 13 angry democrats (plus people who worked 8 years for obama) working on the rigged russia witch hunt will be meddling with the mid-term elections especially now that republicans (stay tough!) are taking the lead in polls. there was no collusion except by the democrats!why aren’t the 13 angry and heavily conflicted democrats investigating the totally crooked campaign of totally crooked hillary clinton. it’s a rigged witch hunt that’s why! ask them if they enjoyed her after election celebration!sorry i’ve got to start focusing my energy on north korea nuclear bad trade deals va choice the economy rebuilding the military and so much more and not on the rigged russia witch hunt that should be investigating clinton/russia/fbi/justice/obama/comey/lynch etc.the fake mainstream media has from the time i announced i was running for president run the most highly sophisticated  dishonest disinformation campaign in the history of politics. no matter how well we do they find fault. but the forgotten men  women won i’m president!rep.trey gowdy “i don’t think so i think what the president is doing is expressing frustration that attorney general sessions should have shared these reasons for recusal before he took the job not afterward. if i were the president and i picked someone to be the country’s........chief law enforcement officer and they told me later ‘oh by the way i’m not going to be able to participate in the most important case in the office i would be frustrated too...and that’s how i read that - senator sessions why didn’t you tell me before i picked you.........there are lots of really good lawyers in the country he could have picked somebody else!” and i wish i did!the failing and corrupt @nytimes estimated the crowd last night at “1000 people” when in fact it was many times that number - and the arena was rockin’. this is the way they demean and disparage. they are very dishonest people who don’t “get” me and never did!bob iger of abc called valerie jarrett to let her know that “abc does not tolerate comments like those” made by roseanne barr. gee he never called president donald j. trump to apologize for the horrible statements made and said about me on abc. maybe i just didn’t get the call?there is no one better to represent the people of n.y. and staten island (a place i know very well) than @repdandonovan who is strong on borders  crime loves our military  our vets voted for tax cuts and is helping me to make america great again. dan has my full endorsement!very importantly @repdandonovan will win for the republicans in november...and his opponent will not. remember alabama. we can’t take any chances on losing to a nancy pelosi controlled democrat!the soon to be released book “the russia hoax the illicit scheme to clear hillary clinton and frame donald trump” written by gregg jarrett looks like a real deal big hit. the phony witch hunt will be opened up for the world to see! out in 5 weeks.rush limbaugh  “if the fbi was so concerned and if they weren’t targeting trump they should have told trump. if they were really concerned about the russians infiltrating a campaign (hoax) then why not try to stop it? why not tell trump? because they were pushing this scam.”iger where is my call of apology? you and abc have offended millions of people and they demand a response. how is brian ross doing? he tanked the market with an abc lie yet no apology. double standard!the corrupt mainstream media is working overtime not to mention the infiltration of people spies (informants) into my campaign! surveillance much?not that it matters but i never fired james comey because of russia! the corrupt mainstream media loves to keep pushing that narrative but they know it is not true!very good meetings with north korea.will be giving a full pardon to dinesh d’souza today. he was treated very unfairly by our government!fair trade!a.p. has just reported that the russian hoax investigation has now cost our government over $17 million and going up fast. no collusion except by the democrats!why aren’t they firing no talent samantha bee for the horrible language used on her low ratings show? a total double standard but that’s o.k. we are winning and will be doing so for a long time to come!looking forward to seeing the employment numbers at 8:30 this morning.canada has treated our agricultural business and farmers very poorly for a very long period of time. highly restrictive on trade! they must open their markets and take down their trade barriers! they report a really high surplus on trade with us. do timber  lumber in u.s.?“we ran out of words to describe how good the jobs numbers are.”  neil irwin of the @nytimes.“john brennan no single figure in american history has done more to discredit the intelligence community than this liar. he’s a liar about being a liar.”“john brennan no single figure in american history has done more to discredit the intelligence community than this liar. not only is he a liar he’s a liar about being a liar.”  dan bongino on @foxandfriends....“$17 million spent it’s a scam investigation. americans are being worked. we now know there was russian collusion with russians and the democrats. the mueller team is stacked with anti-trumpers who actually represented clinton people ( gave $’s to crooked h).” dan bonginothere was no collusion with russia (except by the democrats). when will this very expensive witch hunt hoax ever end? so bad for our country. is the special councel/justice department leaking my lawyers letters to the fake news media? should be looking at dems corruption instead?there was no collusion with russia (except by the democrats). when will this very expensive witch hunt hoax ever end? so bad for our country. is the special counsel/justice department leaking my lawyers letters to the fake news media? should be looking at dems corruption instead?the united states must at long last be treated fairly on trade. if we charge a country zero to sell their goods and they charge us 25 50 or even 100 percent to sell ours it is unfair and can no longer be tolerated. that is not free or fair trade it is stupid trade!why is it that the wall street journal though well meaning never mentions the unfairness of the tariffs routinely charged against the u.s. by other countries or the many billions of dollars that the tariffs we are now charging are and will be pouring into u.s. coffers?when you’re almost 800 billion dollars a year down on trade you can’t lose a trade war! the u.s. has been ripped off by other countries for years on trade time to get smart!jesse watters “the only thing trump obstructed was hillary getting to the white house.”  so true!as only one of two people left who could become president why wouldn’t the fbi or department of “justice” have told me that they were secretly investigating paul manafort (on charges that were 10 years old and had been previously dropped) during my campaign? should have told me!....paul manafort came into the campaign very late and was with us for a short period of time (he represented ronald reagan bob dole  many others over the years) but we should have been told that comey and the boys were doing a number on him and he wouldn’t have been hired!mark penn  “why are there people from the clinton foundation on the mueller staff? why is there an independent councel? to go after people and their families for unrelated offenses...constitution was set up to prevent this...stormtrooper tactics almost.” a disgrace!mark penn  “why are there people from the clinton foundation on the mueller staff? why is there an independent counsel? to go after people and their families for unrelated offenses...constitution was set up to prevent this...stormtrooper tactics almost.” a disgrace!this is my 500th. day in office and we have accomplished a lot - many believe more than any president in his first 500 days. massive tax  regulation cuts military  vets lower crime  illegal immigration stronger borders judgeships best economy  jobs ever and much more.......we had repeal  replace done (and the saving to our country of one trillion dollars) except for one person but it is getting done anyway.

has been stated by numerous legal scholars i have the absolute right to pardon myself but why would i do that when i have done nothing wrong? in the meantime the never ending witch hunt led by 13 very angry and conflicted democrats ( others) continues into the mid-terms!china already charges a tax of 16% on soybeans. canada has all sorts of trade barriers on our agricultural products. not acceptable!the u.s. has made such bad trade deals over so many years that we can only win!the appointment of the special councel is totally unconstitutional! despite that we play the game because i unlike the democrats have done nothing wrong!farmers have not been doing well for 15 years. mexico canada china and others have treated them unfairly. by the time i finish trade talks that will change. big trade barriers against u.s. farmers and other businesses will finally be broken. massive trade deficits no longer!the appointment of the special counsel is totally unconstitutional! despite that we play the game because i unlike the democrats have done nothing wrong!the fake news media is desperate to distract from the economy and record setting economic numbers and so they keep talking about the phony russian witch hunt.in many ways this is the greatest economy in the history of america and the best time ever to look for a job!big supreme court ruling for baker just out!the philadelphia eagles football team was invited to the white house. unfortunately only a small number of players decided to come and we canceled the event. staying in the locker room for the playing of

spending and to what end? no more.wow strzok-page the incompetent  corrupt fbi lovers have texts referring to a counter-intelligence operation into the trump campaign dating way back to december 2015. spygate is in full force! is the mainstream media interested yet? big stuff!great interview by @loudobbs with chris farrell of judicial watch concerning the governments counter-intelligence operation into the trump campaign. spygate at the highest level. who would believe?chris farrell judicial watch. “they were running an operation to undermine a candidate for president of the u.s. these are all violations of law. this is intelligence tradecraft to steer an election. there’s nothing more grave when it comes to abuse of our intelligence system......this is a level of criminality beyond the pale. this is such a grave abuse of power and authority it’s like nothing else we’ve seen in our history. this makes the nixon watergate burglary look like keystone cop stuff....the greatest witch hunt in political history!mitch mcconnell announced he will cancel the senate’s august recess. great maybe the democrats will finally get something done other than their acceptance of high crime and high taxes. we need border security!great night for republicans! congratulations to john cox on a really big number in california. he can win. even fake news cnn said the trump impact was really big

(and me) for n.y. or virginia to abuse. all fake she is doing really well!...four reporters spotted melania in the white house last week walking merrily along to a meeting. they never reported the sighting because it would hurt the sick narrative that she was living in a different part of the world was really ill or whatever. fake news is really bad!many more republican voters showed up

counsel....all of this could have been done by the justice dept. don’t need a multi-million dollar group of people with a target on someone’s back. not the way justice should operate.” so true!when and where will all of the many conflicts of interest be listed by the 13 angry democrats (plus) working on the witch hunt hoax. there has never been a group of people on a case so biased or conflicted. it is all a democrat excuse for losing the election. where is the server?how could jeff flake who is setting record low polling numbers in arizona and was therefore humiliatingly forced out of his own senate seat without even a fight (and who doesn’t have a clue) think about running for office even a lower one again? let’s face it he’s a flake!our justice department must not let awan  debbie wasserman schultz off the hook. the democrat i.t. scandal is a key to much of the corruption we see today. they want to make a “plea deal” to hide what is on their server. where is server? really bad!the obama administration is now accused of trying to give iran secret access to the financial system of the united states. this is totally illegal. perhaps we could get the 13 angry democrats to divert some of their energy to this “matter” (as comey would call it). investigate!please tell prime minister trudeau and president macron that they are charging the u.s. massive tariffs and create non-monetary barriers. the eu trade surplus with the u.s. is $151 billion and canada keeps our farmers and others out. look forward to seeing them tomorrow.prime minister trudeau is being so indignant bringing up the relationship that the u.s. and canada had over the many years and all sorts of other things...but he doesn’t bring up the fact that they charge us up to 300% on dairy — hurting our farmers killing our agriculture!why isn’t the european union and canada informing the public that for years they have used massive trade tariffs and non-monetary trade barriers against the u.s. totally unfair to our farmers workers  companies. take down your tariffs  barriers or we will more than match you!obama schumer and pelosi did nothing about north korea and now weak on crime high tax schumer is telling me what to do at the summit the dems could never set up. schumer failed with north korea and iran we don’t need his advice!canada charges the u.s. a 270%  tariff on dairy products! they didn’t tell you that did they? not fair to our farmers!looking forward to straightening out unfair trade deals with the g-7 countries. if it doesn’t happen we come out even better!i am heading for canada and the g-7 for talks that will mostly center on the long time unfair trade practiced against the united states. from there i go to singapore and talks with north korea on

know i cannot allow them to apply large tariffs and strong barriers to......u.s.a. trade. they fully understand where i am coming from. after many decades fair and reciprocal trade will happen!the united states will not allow other countries to impose massive tariffs and trade barriers on its farmers workers and companies. while sending their product into our country tax free. we have put up with trade abuse for many decades — and that is long enough.i am on my way to singapore where we have a chance to achieve a truly wonderful result for north korea and the world. it will certainly be an exciting day and i know that kim jong-un will work very hard to do something that has rarely been done before...…create peace and great prosperity for his land. i look forward to meeting him and have a feeling that this one-time opportunity will not be wasted!based on justin’s false statements at his news conference and the fact that canada is charging massive tariffs to our u.s. farmers workers and companies i have instructed our u.s. reps not to endorse the communique as we look at tariffs on automobiles flooding the u.s. market!pm justin trudeau of canada acted so meek and mild during our @g7 meetings only to give a news conference after i left saying that “us tariffs were kind of insulting” and he “will not be pushed around.” very dishonest  weak. our tariffs are in response to his of 270% on dairy!why should i as president of the united states allow countries to continue to make massive trade surpluses as they have for decades while our farmers workers  taxpayers have such a big and unfair price to pay? not fair to the people of america! $800 billion trade deficit.......and add to that the fact that the u.s. pays close to the entire cost of nato-protecting many of these same countries that rip us off on trade (they pay only a fraction of the cost-and laugh!). the european union had a $151 billion surplus-should pay much more for military!....germany pays 1% (slowly) of gdp towards nato while we pay 4% of a much larger gdp. does anybody believe that makes sense? we protect europe (which is good) at great financial loss and then get unfairly clobbered on trade. change is coming!great to be in singapore excitement in the air!sorry we cannot let our friends or enemies take advantage of us on trade anymore. we must put the american worker first!meetings between staffs and representatives are going well and quickly....but in the end that doesn’t matter. we will all know soon whether or not a real deal unlike those of the

shouldn’t meet do not meet!”my political representatives didn’t want me to get involved in the mark sanford primary thinking that sanford would easily win - but with a few hours left i felt that katie

crime and borders and wants to raise your taxes through the roof. don’t underestimate corey a major chance of winning!just landed - a long trip but everybody can now feel much safer than the day i took office. there is no longer a nuclear threat from north korea. meeting with kim jong un was an interesting and very positive experience. north korea has great potential for the future!before taking office people were assuming that we were going to war with north korea. president obama said that north korea was our biggest and most dangerous problem. no longer - sleep well tonight!we save a fortune by not doing war games as long as we are negotiating in good faith - which both sides are!the u.s. together with mexico and canada just got the world cup. congratulations - a great deal of hard work!oil prices are too high opec is at it again. not good!so funny to watch the fake news especially nbc and cnn. they are fighting hard to downplay the deal with north korea. 500 days ago they

starting to show very big numbers. people are starting to see what is being done. results are speaking loudly. north korea and our greatest ever economy are leading the way!now that i am back from singapore where we had a great result with respect to north korea the thought process must sadly go back to the witch hunt always remembering that there was no collusion and no obstruction of the fabricated no crime.so the democrats make up a phony crime collusion with the russians pay a fortune to make the crime sound real illegally leak (comey) classified information so that a special councel will be appointed and then collude to make this pile of garbage take on life in fake news!the sleazy new york democrats and their now disgraced (and run out of town) a.g. eric schneiderman are doing everything they can to sue me on a foundation that took in $18800000 and gave out to charity more money than it took in $19200000. i won’t settle this case!.......schneiderman who ran the clinton campaign in new york never had the guts to bring this ridiculous case which lingered in their office for almost 2 years. now he resigned his office in disgrace and his disciples brought it when we would not settle.fbi agent peter strzok who headed the clinton  russia investigations texted to his lover lisa page in the ig report that “we’ll stop” candidate trump from becoming president. doesn’t get any lower than that!the ig report is a total disaster for comey his minions and sadly the fbi. comey will now officially go down as the worst leader by far in the history of the fbi. i did a great service to the people in firing him. good instincts. christopher wray will bring it proudly back!thank you for all of the compliments on getting the world cup to come to the u.s.a. mexico and canada. i worked hard on this along with a great team of talented people. we never fail and it will be a great world cup! a special thanks to bob kraft for excellent advice.u.s.a. jobs numbers are the best in 44 years. if my opponent (the democrats) had won the election they would have raised taxes substantially and increased regulations - the economy and jobs would have been a disaster!wow the highest rated (by far) morning show @foxandfriends is on the front lawn of the white house. maybe i’ll have to take an unannounced trip down to see them?“why in the world didn’t barack obama fire this guy (comey)?” asks mark levin!“donald trump was 100% right to fire james comey.” mark levinwow what a tough sentence for paul manafort who has represented ronald reagan bob dole and many other top political people and campaigns. didn’t know manafort was the head of the mob. what about comey and crooked hillary and all of the others? very unfair!i’ve had to beat 17 very talented people including the bush dynasty then i had to beat the clinton dynasty and now i have to beat a phony witch hunt and all of the dishonest people covered in the ig report...and never forget the fake news media. it never ends!democrats can fix their forced family breakup at the border by working with republicans on new legislation for a change! this is why we need more republicans elected in november. democrats are good at only three things high taxes high crime and obstruction. sad!my supporters are the smartest strongest most hard working and most loyal that we have seen in our countries history. it is a beautiful thing to watch as we win elections and gather support from all over the country. as we get stronger so does our country. best numbers ever!the ig report totally distroys james comey and all of his minions including the great lovers peter strzok and lisa page who started the disgraceful witch hunt against so many innocent people. it will go down as a dark and dangerous period in american history!the ig report totally destroys james comey and all of his minions including the great lovers peter strzok and lisa page who started the disgraceful witch hunt against so many innocent people. it will go down as a dark and dangerous period in american history!chuck schumer said “the summit was what the texans call all cattle and no hat.” thank you chuck but are you sure you got that right? no more nuclear testing or rockets flying all over the place blew up launch sites. hostages already back hero remains coming home  much more!daniel henninger of the wall street journal: “this ig report makes it clear as did rod rosenstein’s memo that trump was absolutely justified unquestionably justified in firing jim comey. so i think the mueller investigation is on pretty weak grounds right now.”  witch hunt!funny how the fake news in a coordinated effort with each other likes to say i gave sooo much to north korea because i “met.” that’s because that’s all they have to disparage! we got so much for peace in the world  more is being added in finals. even got our hostages/remains!holding back the “war games” during the negotiations was my request because they are very expensive and set a bad light during a good faith negotiation. also quite provocative. can start up immediately if talks break down which i hope will not happen!the denuclearization deal with north korea is being praised and celebrated all over asia. they are so happy! over here in our country some people would rather see this historic deal fail than give trump a win even if it does save potentially millions  millions of lives!our economy is perhaps better than it has ever been. companies doing really well and moving back to america and jobs numbers are the best in 44 years.washington post employees want to go on strike because bezos isn’t paying them enough. i think a really long strike would be a great idea. employees would get more money and we would get rid of fake news for an extended period of time! is @wapo a registered lobbyist?witch hunt! there was no russian collusion. oh i see there was no russian collusion so now they look for obstruction on the no russian collusion. the phony russian collusion was a made up hoax. too bad they didn’t look at crooked hillary like this. double standard!why was the fbi giving so much information to the fake news media. they are not supposed to be doing that and knowing the enemy of the people fake news they put their own spin on it - truth doesn’t matter to them!why was the fbi’s sick loser peter strzok working on the totally discredited mueller team of 13 angry  conflicted democrats when strzok was giving crooked hillary a free pass yet telling his lover lawyer lisa page that “we’ll stop” trump from becoming president? witch hunt!the democrats should get together with their republican counterparts and work something out on border security  safety. don’t wait until after the election because you are going to lose!“the highest level of bias i’ve ever witnessed in any law enforcement officer.” trey gowdy on the fbi’s own peter strzok. also remember that they all worked for slippery james comey and that comey is best friends with robert mueller. a really sick deal isn’t it?why don’t the democrats give us the votes to fix the world’s worst immigration laws? where is the outcry for the killings and crime being caused by gangs and thugs including ms-13 coming into our country illegally?the people of germany are turning against their leadership as migration is rocking the already tenuous berlin coalition. crime in germany is way up. big mistake made all over europe in allowing millions of people in who have so strongly and violently changed their culture!children are being used by some of the worst criminals on earth as a means to enter our country. has anyone been looking at the crime taking place south of the border. it is historic with some countries the most dangerous places in the world. not going to happen in the u.s.change the laws!it is the democrats fault for being weak and ineffective with boarder security and crime. tell them to start thinking about the people devastated by crime coming from illegal immigration. change the laws!if president obama (who got nowhere with north korea and would have had to go to war with many millions of people being killed) had gotten along with north korea and made the initial steps toward a deal that i have the fake news would have named him a national hero!i can’t think of something more concerning than a law enforcement officer suggesting that their going to use their powers to affect an election!” inspector general horowitz on what was going on with numerous people regarding my election. a rigged witch hunt!pcrime in germany is up 10% plus (officials do not want to report these crimes) since migrants were accepted. others countries are even worse. be smart america!if you don’t have borders you don’t have a country!democrats are the problem. they don’t care about crime and want illegal immigrants no matter how bad they may be to pour into and infest our country like ms-13. they can’t win on their terrible policies so they view them as potential voters!we must always arrest people coming into our country illegally. of the 12000 children 10000 are being sent by their parents on a very dangerous trip and only 2000 are with their parents many of whom have tried to enter our country illegally on numerous occasions.#changethelaws   now is the best opportunity ever for congress to change the ridiculous and obsolete laws on immigration. get it done always keeping in mind that we must have strong border security.homeland security @secnielsen did a fabulous job yesterday at the press conference explaining security at the border and for our country while at the same time recommending changes to obsolete  nasty laws which force family separation. we want “heart” and security in america!the fake news is not mentioning the safety and security of our country when talking about illegal immigration. our immigration laws are the weakest and worst anywhere in the world and the dems will do anything not to change them  to obstruct-want open borders which means crime!it’s the democrats fault they won’t give us the votes needed to pass good immigration legislation. they want open borders which breeds horrible crime. republicans want security. but i am working on something - it never ends!“fbi texts have revealed anti-trump bias.” @foxnews  big news but the fake news doesn’t want to cover. total corruption - the witch hunt has turned out to be a scam! at some point soon the mainstream media will have to cover correctly too big a story!had a great meeting with the house gop last night at the capitol. they applauded and laughed loudly when i mentioned my experience with mark sanford. i have never been a fan of his!just landed in duluth minnesota. two events planned -

could not get in - i will return! congratulations to @petestauber who is loved and respected in minnesota!we shouldn’t be hiring judges by the thousands as our ridiculous immigration laws demand we should be changing our laws building the wall hire border agents and ice and not let people come into our country based on the legal phrase they are told to say as their password.the border has been a big mess and problem for many years. at some point schumer and pelosi who are weak on crime and border security will be forced to do a real deal so easy that solves this long time problem. schumer used to want border security - now he’ll take crime!i will be going the columbia south carolina on monday night to do a campaign speech for one of my very early supporters a man who truly loves the people of south carolina governor henry mcmaster. henry worked so hard  was so loyal to me that i look forward to reciprocating!henry mcmaster has done a great job as governor of south carolina. the

and his talented representatives for having pulled it off. great job!the democrats are making a strong push to abolish ice one of the smartest toughest and most spirited law enforcement groups of men and women that i have ever seen. i have watched ice liberate towns from the grasp of ms-13  clean out the toughest of situations. they are great!to the great and brave men and women of ice do not worry or lose your spirit. you are doing a fantastic job of keeping us safe by eradicating the worst criminal elements. so brave! the radical left dems want you out. next it will be all police. zero

president.” it is a story told with both heart and knowledge. really good go get it!i never pushed the republicans in the house to vote for the immigration bill either goodlatte 1 or 2 because it could never have gotten enough democrats as long as there is the 60 vote threshold. i released many prior to the vote knowing we need more republicans to win in nov.either we need to elect more republicans in november or republicans must end the ridiculous 60 vote or filibuster rule - or better yet do both. cryin’ chuck would do it on day one but we’ll never give him the chance. some great legislation awaits - be smart!i will be interviewed by @mariabartiromo on sunday on @foxnews at 10:00 a. m. enjoy!when people come into our country illegally we must immediately escort them back out

forward to working with him. there is much to be done that will benefit both the united states and mexico!many democrats are deeply concerned about the fact that their “leadership” wants to denounce and abandon the great men and women of ice thereby declaring war on law  order. these people will be voting for republicans in november and in many cases joining the republican party!crazy maxine waters said by some to be one of the most corrupt people in politics is rapidly becoming together with nancy pelosi the face of the democrat party. her ranting and raving even referring to herself as a wounded animal will make people flee the democrats!the economy is doing perhaps better than ever before and that’s prior to fixing some of the worst and most unfair trade deals ever made by any country. in any event they are coming along very well. most countries agree that they must be changed but nobody ever asked!when we have an “infestation” of ms-13 gangs in certain parts of our country who do we send to get them out? ice! they are tougher and smarter than these rough criminal elelments that bad immigration laws allow into our country. dems do not appreciate the great job they do! nov.how can the democrats who are weak on the border and weak on crime do well in november. the people of our country want and demand safety and security while the democrats are more interested in  ripping apart and demeaning (and not properly funding) our great law enforcement!many good conversations with north korea-it is going well! in the meantime no rocket launches or nuclear testing in 8 months. all of asia is thrilled. only the opposition party which includes the fake news is complaining. if not for me we would now be at war with north korea!just out that the obama administration granted citizenship during the terrible iran deal negotiation to 2500 iranians - including to government officials. how big (and bad) is that?now that harley-davidson is moving part of its operation

washington post is constantly quoting “anonymous sources” that do not exist. rarely do they use the name of anyone because there is no one to give them the kind of negative quote that they are looking for. they are a discgrace to journalism but then again so are many others!after having written many best selling books and somewhat priding myself on my ability to write it should be noted that the fake news constantly likes to pour over my tweets looking for a mistake. i capitalize certain words only for emphasis not b/c they should be capitalized!heading to west virginia to be with my friend

smart fast and reasonable immigration laws now. law enforcement at the border is doing a great job but the laws they are forced to work with are insane. when people with or without children enter our country they must be told to leave without our.............country being forced to endure a long and costly trial. tell the people “out” and they must leave just as they would if they were standing on your front lawn. hiring thousands of “judges” does not work and is not acceptable - only country in the world that does this!congress - fix our insane immigration laws now!i have accepted the resignation of scott pruitt as the administrator of the environmental protection agency. within the agency scott has done an outstanding job and i will always be thankful to him for this. the senate confirmed deputy at epa andrew wheeler will......on monday assume duties as the acting administrator of the epa. i have no doubt that andy will continue on with our great and lasting epa agenda. we have made tremendous progress and the future of the epa is very bright!a vote for democrats in november is a vote to let ms-13 run wild in our communities to let drugs pour into our cities and to take jobs and benefits away from hardworking americans. democrats want anarchy amnesty and chaos - republicans want law order and justice!every day the brave men and women of ice are liberating communities from savage gangs like ms-13. we will not stand for these vile democrat smears in law enforcement. we will always stand proudly with the brave heroes of ice and border patrol!thanks to republican

record pace. will that include the failing new york times and propaganda machine for amazon the washington post who constantly quote anonymous sources that in my opinion don’t exist - they will both be out of business in 7 years!big decision will soon be made on our next justice of the supreme court!public opinion has turned strongly against the rigged witch hunt and the “special” councel because

spending far more on nato than any other country. this is not fair nor is it acceptable. while these countries have been increasing their contributions since i took office they must do much more. germany is at 1% the u.s. is at 4% and nato benefits..........europe far more than it does the u.s. by some accounts the u.s. is paying for 90% of nato with many countries nowhere close to their 2% commitment. on top of this the european union has a trade surplus of $151 million with the u.s. with big trade barriers on u.s. goods. no!i have long heard that the most important decision a u.s. president can make is the selection of a supreme court justice - will be announced tonight at 9:00 p.m.i have confidence that kim jong un will honor the contract we signed  even more importantly our handshake. we agreed to the denuclearization of north korea. china on the other hand may be exerting negative pressure on a deal because of our posture on chinese trade-hope not!the failing ny times fake news story today about breast feeding must be called out. the u.s. strongly supports breast feeding but we don’t believe women should be denied access to formula. many women need this option because of malnutrition and poverty.pfizer  others should be ashamed that they have raised drug prices for no reason. they are merely taking advantage of the poor  others unable to defend themselves while at the same time giving bargain basement prices to other countries in europe  elsewhere. we will respond!getting ready to leave for europe. first meeting - nato. the u.s. is spending many times more than any other country in order to protect them. not fair to the u.s. taxpayer. on top of that we lose $151 billion on trade with the european union. charge us big tariffs ( barriers)!nato countries must pay more the united states must pay less. very unfair!on behalf of the united states congratulations to the thai navy seals and all on the successful rescue of the 12 boys and their coach from the treacherous cave in thailand. such a beautiful moment - all freed great job!i am on air force one flying to nato and hear reports that the fbi lovers peter strzok and lisa page are getting cold feet on testifying about  the rigged witch hunt headed by 13 angry democrats and people that worked for obama for 8 years. total disgrace!a recent emerson college epoll said that most americans especially hispanics feel that they are better off under president trump than they were under president obama.the european union makes it impossible for our farmers and workers and companies to do business in europe (u.s. has a $151 billion trade deficit) and then they want us to happily defend them through nato and nicely pay for it. just doesn’t work!just talked with pfizer ceo and @secazar on our drug pricing blueprint. pfizer is rolling back price hikes so american patients don’t pay more. we applaud pfizer for this decision and hope other companies do the same. great news for the american people!i am in brussels but always thinking about our farmers. soy beans fell 50% from 2012 to my election. farmers have done poorly for 15 years. other countries’ trade barriers and tariffs have been destroying their businesses. i will open......things up better than ever before but it can’t go too quickly. i am fighting for a level playing field for our farmers and will win!democrats in congress must no longer obstruct - vote to fix our terrible immigration laws now. i am watching what is going on from europe - it would be soooo simple to fix. judges run the system and illegals and traffickers know how it works. they are just using children!what good is nato if germany is paying russia billions of dollars for gas and energy? why are their only 5 out of 29 countries that have met their commitment? the u.s. is paying for europe’s protection then loses billions on trade. must pay 2% of gdp immediately not by 2025.what good is nato if germany is paying russia billions of dollars for gas and energy? why are there only 5 out of 29 countries that have met their commitment? the u.s. is paying for europe’s protection then loses billions on trade. must pay 2% of gdp immediately not by 2025.if the democrats want to win supreme court and other court picks don’t obstruct and resist but rather do it the good ol’ fashioned way win elections!ex-fbi layer lisa page today defied a house of representatives issued subpoena to testify before congress! wow but is anybody really surprised!  together with her lover fbi agent peter strzok she worked on the rigged witch hunt perhaps the most tainted and corrupt case ever!how can the rigged witch hunt proceed when it was started influenced and worked on for an extended period of time by former fbi agent/lover peter strzok? read his hate filled and totally biased emails and the answer is clear!billions of additional dollars are being spent by nato countries since my visit last year at my request but it isn’t nearly enough. u.s. spends too much. europe’s borders are bad! pipeline dollars to russia are not acceptable!as i head out to a very important nato meeting i see that fbi lover/agent lisa page is dodging a subpoena  is refusing to show up and testify. what can she possibly say about her statements and lies. so much corruption on the other side. where is the attorney general? @foxnewspresidents have been trying unsuccessfully for years to get germany and other rich nato nations to pay more toward their protection from russia. they pay only a fraction of their cost. the u.s. pays tens of billions of dollars too much to subsidize europe and loses big on trade!....on top of it all germany just started paying russia the country they want protection from billions of dollars for their energy needs coming out of a new pipeline from russia. not acceptable! all nato nations must meet their 2% commitment and that must ultimately go to 4%!congressman matt gaetz of florida is one of the finest and most talented people in congress. strong on crime the border illegal immigration the 2nd amendment our great military  vets matt worked tirelessly on helping to get our massive tax cuts. he has my full endorsement!i have arrived in scotland and will be at trump turnberry for two days of meetings calls and hopefully some golf - my primary form of exercise! the weather is beautiful and this place is incredible! tomorrow i go to helsinki for a monday meeting with vladimir putin.the stock market hit 25000 yesterday. jobs are at an all time record - and that is before we fix some of the worst trade deals and conditions ever seen by any government. it is all happening!the stories you heard about the 12 russians yesterday took place during the obama administration not the trump administrations. why didn’t they do something about it especially when it was reported that president obama was informed by the fbi in september before the election?....where is the dnc server and why didn’t the fbi take possession of it? deep state?the stories you heard about the 12 russians yesterday took place during the obama administration not the trump administration. why didn’t they do something about it especially when it was reported that president obama was informed by the fbi in september before the election?so funny! i just checked out fake news cnn for the first time in a long time (they are dying in the ratings) to see if they covered my takedown yesterday of jim acosta (actually a nice guy). they didn’t! but they did say i already lost in my meeting with putin. fake news..........remember it was little jeff z and his people who are told exactly what to say who said i could not win the election in that “there was no way to 270” (over  over again) in the electoral college. i got 306! they were sooooo wrong in their election coverage. still hurting!these russian individuals did their work during the obama years. why didn’t obama do something about it?  because he thought crooked hillary clinton would win that’s why. had nothing to do with the trump administration but fake news doesn’t want to report the truth as usual!there hasn’t been a missile or rocket fired in 9 months in north korea there have been no nuclear tests and we got back our hostages. who knows how it will all turn out in the end but why isn’t the fake news talking about these wonderful facts? because it is fake news!heading to helsinki finland – looking forward to meeting with president putin tomorrow. unfortunately no matter how well i do at the summit if i was given the great city of moscow as retribution for all of the sins and evils committed by russia......over the years i would return to criticism that it wasn’t good enough – that i should have gotten saint petersburg in addition! much of our news media is indeed the enemy of the people and all the dems......know how to do is resist and obstruct! this is why there is such hatred and dissension in our country – but at some point it will heal!congratulations to france who played extraordinary soccer on winning the 2018 world cup. additionally congratulations to president putin and russia for putting on a truly great world cup tournament -- one of the best ever!received many calls from leaders of nato countries thanking me for helping to bring them together and to get them focused on financial obligations both present  future. we had a truly great summit that was inaccurately covered by much of the media. nato is now strong  rich!president obama thought that crooked hillary was going to win the election so when he was informed by the fbi about russian meddling he said it couldn’t happen was no big deal  did nothing about it. when i won it became a big deal and the rigged witch hunt headed by strzok!our relationship with russia has never been worse thanks to many years of u.s. foolishness and stupidity and now the rigged witch hunt!as i said today and many times before “i have great confidence in my intelligence people.” however i also recognize that in order to build a brighter future we cannot exclusively focus on the past – as the world’s two largest nuclear powers we must get along! #helsinki2018will be interviewed on @seanhannity tonight at 9pme and @tuckercarlson tomorrow night at 8pme. enjoy!thank you @randpaul you really get it! “the president has gone through a year and a half of totally partisan investigations - what’s he supposed think?”while i had a great meeting with nato raising vast amounts of money i had an even better meeting with vladimir putin of russia. sadly it is not being reported that way - the fake news is going crazy!the economy of the united states is stronger than ever before!the meeting between president putin and myself was a great success except in the fake news media!the democrats want to abolish ice which will mean more crime in our country. i want to give ice a big cheer! vote

american history.” thank you to the great lou dobbs!so many people at the higher ends of intelligence loved my press conference performance in helsinki. putin and i discussed many important subjects at our earlier meeting. we got along well which truly bothered many haters who wanted to see a boxing match. big results will come!while the nato meeting in brussels was an acknowledged triumph with billions of dollars more being put up by member countries at a faster pace the meeting with russia may prove to be in the long run an even greater success. many positive things will come out of that meeting......russia has agreed to help with north korea where relationships with us are very good and the process is moving along. there is no rush the sanctions remain! big benefits and exciting future for north korea at end of process!congratulations to martha roby of the great state of alabama on her big gop primary win for congress. my endorsement came appropriately late but when it came the “flood gates” opened and you had the kind of landslide victory that you deserve. enjoy!“a lot of democrats wished they voted for the tax cuts because the economy is booming - we could have 4% growth now and the fed said yesterday that unemployment could drop again.”  @foxandfriends  @kilmeadesome people hate the fact that i got along well with president putin of russia. they would rather go to war than see this. it’s called trump derangement syndrome!3.4 million jobs created since our great election victory - far greater than ever anticipated and only getting better as new and greatly improved trade deals start coming to fruition!brian kemp is running for governor of the great state of georgia. the primary is on tuesday. brian is tough on crime strong on the border and illegal immigration. he loves our military and our vets and protects our second amendment. i give him my full and total endorsement.thank you to congressman kevin yoder! he secured $5 billion for border security. now we need congress to support. kevin has been strong on crime the border the 2nd amendment and he loves our military and vets. @repkevinyoder has my full and total endorsement!a total disgrace that turkey will not release a respected u.s. pastor andrew brunson from prison. he has been held hostage far too long. @rt_erdogan should do something to free this wonderful christian husband  father. he has done nothing wrong and his family needs him!thank you to novartis for not increasing your prices on prescription drugs. likewise to pfizer. we are making a big push to actually reduce the prices maybe substantially on prescription drugs.the democrats have a death wish in more ways than one - they actually want to abolish ice. this should cost them heavily in the midterms. yesterday the republicans overwhelmingly passed a bill supporting ice!the fake news media is going crazy! they make up stories without any backup sources or proof. many of the stories written about me and the good people surrounding me are total fiction. problem is when you complain you just give them more publicity. but i’ll complain anyway!the fake news media wants so badly to see a major confrontation with russia even a confrontation that could lead to war. they are pushing so recklessly hard and hate the fact that i’ll probably have a good relationship with putin. we are doing much better than any other country!“trump recognized russian meddling many times.” thank you to @foxandfriends and @foxnews for actually showing the clips. the fake news wants no part of that narrative! too bad they don’t want to focus on all of the economic and jobs records being set.really big jobs meeting today at the white house! 3 p.m.i told you so! the european union just slapped a five billion dollar fine on one of our great companies google. they truly have taken advantage of the u.s. but not for long!the summit with russia was a great success except with the real enemy of the people the fake news media. i look forward to our second meeting so that we can start implementing some of the many things discussed including stopping terrorism security for israel nuclear............proliferation cyber attacks trade ukraine middle east peace north korea and more. there are many answers some easy and some hard to these problems...but they can all be solved!china the european union and others have been manipulating their currencies and interest rates lower while the u.s. is raising rates while the dollars gets stronger and stronger with each passing day - taking away our big competitive edge. as usual not a level playing field.......the united states should not be penalized because we are doing so well. tightening now hurts all that we have done. the u.s. should be allowed to recapture what was lost due to illegal currency manipulation and bad trade deals. debt coming due  we are raising rates - really?farmers have been on a downward trend for 15 years. the price of soybeans has fallen 50% since 5 years before the election. a big reason is bad (terrible) trade deals with other countries. they put on massive tariffs and barriers. canada charges 275% on dairy. farmers will win!i got severely criticized by the fake news media for being too nice to president putin. in the old days they would call it diplomacy. if i was loud  vicious i would have been criticized for being too tough. remember when they said i was too tough with chairman kim? hypocrites!the nfl national anthem debate is alive and well again - can’t believe it! isn’t it in contract that players must stand at attention hand on heart? the $40000000 commissioner must now make a stand. first time kneeling out for game. second time kneeling out for season/no pay!inconceivable that the government would break into a lawyer’s office (early in the morning) - almost unheard of. even more inconceivable that a lawyer would tape a client - totally unheard of  perhaps illegal. the good news is that your favorite president did nothing wrong!the rigged witch hunt headed by the 13 angry democrats (and now 4 more have been added one who worked directly for obama w.h.) seems intent on damaging the republican party’s chances in the november election. this democrat excuse for losing the ‘16 election never ends!no collusion no obstruction - but that doesn’t matter because the 13 angry democrats who are only after republicans and totally protecting democrats want this witch hunt to drag out to the november election. republicans better get smart fast and expose what they are doing!brian kemp who is running for governor of georgia and has my full endorsement is campaigning tonight with @mikepencevp. brian is very strong on crime and borders loves our military vets and the 2nd amendment. he will be a great governor!brian kemp who is running for governor of georgia and has my full endorsement is campaigning tonight with vp @mike_pence. brian is very strong on crime and borders loves our military vets and the 2nd amendment. he will be a great governor!troy balderson of ohio is running for congress against a nancy pelosi liberal who is weak on

angeles possible hostage situation very closely. active barricaded suspect. l.a.p.d. working with federal law enforcement.congratulations to @judicialwatch and @tomfitton on being successful in getting the carter page fisa documents. as usual they are ridiculously heavily redacted but confirm with little doubt that the department of “justice” and fbi misled the courts. witch hunt rigged a scam!looking more  more like the trump campaign for president was illegally being spied upon (surveillance) for the political gain of crooked hillary clinton and the dnc. ask her how that worked out - she did better with crazy bernie. republicans must get tough now. an illegal scam!andrew mccarthy - “i said this could never happen. this is so bad that they should be looking at the judges who signed off on this stuff not just the people who gave it. it is so bad it screams out at you.”  on the whole fisa scam which led to the rigged mueller witch hunt!.@petehegseth on @foxnews  “source #1 was the (fake) dossier. yes the dirty dossier paid for by democrats as a hit piece against trump and looking for information that could discredit candidate #1 trump. carter page was just the foot to surveil the trump campaign...” illegal!i had a great meeting with putin and the fake news used every bit of their energy to try and disparage it. so bad for our country!so president obama knew about russia before the election. why didn’t he do something about it? why didn’t he tell our campaign? because it is all a big hoax that’s why and he thought crooked hillary was going to win!!!to iranian president rouhani: never ever threaten the united states again or you will suffer consequences the likes of which few throughout history have ever suffered before. we are no longer a country that will stand for your demented words of violence  death. be cautious!tom fitton on @foxandfriends at 6:15 a.m. now! judicial watch.so we now find out that it was indeed the unverified and fake dirty dossier that was paid for by crooked hillary clinton and the dnc that was knowingly  falsely submitted to fisa and which was responsible for starting the totally conflicted and discredited mueller witch hunt!“it was classified to cover up misconduct by the fbi and the justice department in misleading the court by using this dossier in a dishonest way to gain a warrant to target the trump team. this is a clinton campaign document. it was a fraud and a hoax designed to target trump........and the doj fbi and obama gang need to be held to account. source #1 was the major source. avoided talking about it being the clinton campaign behind it. misled the court to provide a pretext to spy on the trump team. not about carter page..was all about getting trump..........”carter page wasn’t a spy wasn’t an agent of the russians - he would have cooperated with the fbi. it was a fraud and a hoax designed to target trump.” tom fitton @judicialwatch a disgrace to america. they should drop the discredited mueller witch hunt now!a rocket has not been launched by north korea in 9 months. likewise no nuclear tests. japan is happy all of asia is happy. but the fake news is saying without ever asking me (always anonymous sources) that i am angry because it is not going fast enough. wrong very happy!the amazon washington post has gone crazy against me ever since they lost the internet tax case in the u.s. supreme court two months ago. next up is the u.s. post office which they use at a fraction of real cost as their “delivery boy” for a big percentage of their packages........in my opinion the washington post is nothing more than an expensive (the paper loses a fortune) lobbyist for amazon. is it used as protection against antitrust claims which many feel should be brought?countries that have treated us unfairly on trade for years are all coming to washington to negotiate. this should have taken place many years ago butas the saying goes better late than never!tariffs are the greatest! either a country which has treated the united states unfairly on trade negotiates a fair deal or it gets hit with tariffs. it’s as simple as that - and everybody’s talking! remember we are the “piggy bank” that’s being robbed. all will be great!our country is doing great. best financial numbers on the planet. great to have usa winning again!make america great again!i’m very concerned that russia will be fighting very hard to have an impact on the upcoming election. based on the fact that no president has been tougher on russia than me they will be pushing very hard for the democrats. they definitely don’t want trump!the european union is coming to washington tomorrow to negotiate a deal on trade. i have an idea for them. both the u.s. and the e.u. drop all tariffs barriers and subsidies! that would finally be called free market and fair trade! hope they do it we are ready - but they won’t!so sad and unfair that the fcc wouldn’t approve the sinclair broadcast merger with tribune. this would have been a great and much needed conservative voice for and of the people. liberal fake news nbc and comcast gets approved much bigger but not sinclair. disgraceful!“the russia hoax the illicit scheme to clear hillary clinton  frame donald trump” is a hot seller already number one! more importantly it is a great book that everyone is talking about. it covers the rigged witch hunt brilliantly. congratulations to gregg jarrett!every time i see a weak politician asking to stop trade talks or the use of tariffs to counter unfair tariffs i wonder what can they be thinking? are we just going to continue and let our farmers and country get ripped off?  lost $817 billion on trade last year. no weakness!when you have people snipping at your heels during a negotiation it will only take longer to make a deal and the deal will never be as good as it could have been with unity. negotiations are going really well be cool. the end result will be worth it!china is targeting our farmers who they know i love  respect as a way of getting me to continue allowing them to take advantage of the u.s. they are being vicious in what will be their failed attempt. we were being nice - until now! china made $517 billion on us last year.what kind of a lawyer would tape a client? so sad! is this a first never heard of it before? why was the tape so abruptly terminated (cut) while i was presumably saying positive things? i hear there are other clients and many reporters that are taped - can this be so? too bad!congratulations to brian kemp on your very big win in georgia last night. wow 69-30 those are big numbers. now go win against the open border crime loving opponent that the democrats have given you. she is weak on vets the military and the 2nd amendment. win!sergio marchionne who passed away today was one of the most brilliant  successful car executives since the days of the legendary henry ford. it was a great honor for me to get to know sergio as potus he loved the car industry and fought hard for it. he will be truly missed!great meeting on trade today with @junckereu and representatives of the european union. we have come to a very strong understanding and are all believers in no tariffs no barriers and no subsidies. work on documents has already started and the process is moving......along quickly. european union nations will be open to the united states and at the same time benefiting by everything we are doing for them. there was great warmth and feeling in the room - a breakthrough has been quickly made that nobody thought possible!thank you georgia! they say that my endorsement last week of brian kemp in the republican primary for governor against a very worthy opponent lifted him from 5 points down to a 70% to 30% victory! two very good and talented men in a great race but congratulations to brian!great to be back on track with the european union. this was a big day for free and fair trade!european union representatives told me that they would start buying soybeans from our great farmers immediately. also they will be buying vast amounts of lng!twitter “shadow banning” prominent republicans. not good. we will look into this discriminatory and illegal practice at once! many complaints.heading to dubuque iowa and then granite city illinois. looking  forward to being with many great friends!the united states will impose large sanctions on turkey for their long time detainment of pastor andrew brunson a great christian family man and wonderful human being. he is suffering greatly. this innocent man of faith should be released immediately!.@alandersh a brilliant lawyer who although a liberal democrat who probably didn’t vote for me has discussed the witch hunt with great clarity and in a very positive way. he has written a new and very important book......called “the case against impeaching trump” which i would encourage all people with trump derangement syndrome to read!the remains of american servicemen will soon be leaving north korea and heading to the united states! after so many years this will be a great moment for so many families. thank you to kim jong un.arrived back in washington last night from a very emotional reopening of a major u.s. steel plant in granite city illinois only to be greeted with the ridiculous news that the highly conflicted robert mueller and his gang of 13 angry democrats obviously cannot find collusion.......the only collusion with russia was with the democrats so now they are looking at my tweets (along with 53 million other people) - the rigged witch hunt continues! how stupid and unfair to our country....and so the fake news doesn’t waste my time with dumb questions no.........i did not know of the meeting with my son don jr. sounds to me like someone is trying to make up stories in order to get himself out of an unrelated jam (taxi cabs maybe?). he even retained bill and crooked hillary’s lawyer. gee i wonder if they helped him make the choice!...john is strong on crime and borders loves our military our vets and our second amendment. he will be a star. he has my full and total endorsement!.@troy_balderson of ohio is running for congress - so important to the republican party. cast you early vote or vote on august 7th. troy is strong on crime and borders loves our military

and borders loves our military vets and second amendment. get out and vote for david on thursday august 2nd. he has my full and total endorsement!democrats who want open borders and care little about crime are incompetent but they have the fake news media almost totally on their side!the only things the democrats do well is “resist” which is their campaign slogan and “obstruct.” cryin’ chuck schumer has almost 400 great american people that are waiting “forever” to serve our country! a total disgrace. mitch m should not let them go home until all approved!tom homan fmr ice director: “there is nobody that has done more for border security  public safety than president trump. i’ve worked for six presidents and i respect them all but nobody has done more than this administration  president trump that’s just a stone cold fact!”wow highest poll numbers in the history of the republican party. that includes honest abe lincoln and ronald reagan. there must be something wrong please recheck that poll!please understand there are consequences when people cross our border illegally whether they have children or not - and many are just using children for their own sinister purposes. congress must act on fixing the dumbest  worst immigration laws anywhere in the world! vote “r”had a very good and interesting meeting at the white house with a.g. sulzberger publisher of the new york times. spent much time talking about the vast amounts of fake news being put out by the media  how that fake news has morphed into phrase “enemy of the people.” sad!the biggest and best results coming out of the good gdp report was that the quarterly trade deficit has been reduced by $52 billion and of course the historically low unemployment numbers especially for african americans hispanics asians and women.i would be willing to “shut down” government if the democrats do not give us the votes for border security which includes the wall! must get rid of lottery catch  release etc. and finally go to system of immigration based on merit! we need great people coming into our country!when the media - driven insane by their trump derangement syndrome - reveals internal deliberations of our government it  truly puts the lives of many not just journalists at risk! very unpatriotic! freedom of the press also comes with a responsibility to report the news......accurately. 90% of media coverage of my administration is negative despite the tremendously positive results we are achieving it’s no surprise that confidence in the media is at an all time low! i will not allow our great country to be sold out by anti-trump haters in the......dying newspaper industry. no matter how much they try to distract and cover it up our country is making great progress under my leadership and i will never stop fighting for the american people! as an example the failing new york times......and the amazon washington post do nothing but write bad stories even on very positive achievements - and they will never change!there is no collusion! the robert mueller rigged witch hunt headed now by 17 (increased from 13 including an obama white house lawyer) angry democrats was started by a fraudulent dossier paid for by crooked hillary and the dnc. therefore the witch hunt is an illegal scam!is robert mueller ever going to release his conflicts of interest with respect to president trump including the fact that we had a very nasty  contentious business relationship i turned him down to head the fbi (one day before appointment as s.c.)  comey is his close friend..we must have border security get rid of chain lottery catch  release sanctuary cities - go to merit based immigration. protect ice and law enforcement and of course keep building but much faster the wall!.@troy_balderson of ohio is running for congress - so important to the republican party. troy is strong on crime and borders loves our military our vets and our second amendment. troy will

tremendous success of her new #1 best-selling book “liars leakers and liberals – the case against the anti-trump conspiracy!”illegal immigration is a top national security problem. after decades of playing games with the whole world laughing at the stupidity of our immigration laws and with democrats thinking......that open borders large scale crime and abolishing ice is good for them we must get smart and finally do what must be done for the safety and security of our country!thank you to @randpaul for your yes on a future great justice of the supreme court brett kavanaugh. your vote means a lot to me and to everyone who loves our country!a highly respected federal judge today stated that the “trump administration gets great credit” for reuniting illegal families. thank you and please look at the previous administrations record - not good!the globalist koch brothers who have become a total joke in real republican circles are against strong borders and powerful trade. i never sought their support because i don’t need their money or bad ideas. they love my tax  regulation cuts judicial picks  more. i made.........them richer. their network is highly overrated i have beaten them at every turn. they want to protect their companies outside the u.s. from being taxed i’m for america first  the american worker - a puppet for no one. two nice guys with bad ideas. make america great again!rush limbaugh is a great guy who truly gets it!one of the reasons we need great border security is that mexico’s murder rate in 2017 increased by 27% to 31174 people killed a record! the democrats want open borders. i want maximum border security and respect for ice and our great law enforcement professionals! @foxnewscollusion is not a crime but that doesn’t matter because there was no collusion (except by crooked hillary and the democrats)!i am looking into 3-d plastic guns being sold to the public. already spoke to nra doesn’t seem to make much sense!will be in tampa tonight. a big year for @repdesantis who will be a great governor for florida. strong on crime borders and our 2nd amendment. big help on tax  regulation cuts. loves our military  our vets. has my full  total endorsement!the fake news media is going crazy! they are totally unhinged and in many ways after witnessing first hand the damage they do to so many innocent and decent people i enjoy watching. in 7 years when i am no longer in office their ratings will dry up and they will be gone!congressman david kustoff has been a champion for the trump agenda - i greatly appreciate his support. david is strong on crime and borders loves our military vets and second amendment. get out and vote for david on thursday august 2nd. he has my full and total endorsement!i don’t care what the political ramifications are our immigration laws and border security have been a complete and total disaster for decades and there is no way that the democrats will allow it to be fixed without a government shutdown......border security is national security and national security is the long-term viability of our country. a government shutdown is a very small price to pay for a safe and prosperous america!“fbi agent peter strzok (on the mueller team) should have recused himself on day one. he was out to stop the election of donald trump. he needed an insurance policy. those are illegal improper goals trying to influence the election. he should never ever been allowed to.............remain in the fbi while he himself was being investigated. this is a real issue. it won’t go into a mueller report because mueller is going to protect these guys. mueller has an interest in creating the illusion of objectivity around his investigation.” alan dershowitz......this is a terrible situation and attorney general jeff sessions should stop this rigged witch hunt right now before it continues to stain our country any further. bob mueller is totally conflicted and his 17 angry democrats that are doing his dirty work are a disgrace to usa!paul manafort worked for ronald reagan bob dole and many other highly prominent and respected political leaders. he worked for me for a very short time. why didn’t government tell me that he was under investigation. these old charges have nothing to do with collusion - a hoax!russian collusion with the trump campaign one of the most successful in history is a total hoax. the democrats paid for the phony and discredited dossier which was along with comey mccabe strzok and his lover the lovely lisa page used to begin the witch hunt. disgraceful!“we already have a smocking gun about a campaign getting dirt on their opponent it was hillary clinton. how is it ok for hillary clinton to proactively seek dirt from the russians but the trump campaign

tariffs against but when we use them foolish people scream!....tariffs will make our country much richer than it is today. only fools would disagree. we are using them to negotiate fair trade deals and if countries are still unwilling to negotiate they will pay us vast sums of money in the form of tariffs. we win either way..........china which is for the first time doing poorly against us is

sick!tariffs are working big time. every country on earth wants to take wealth out of the u.s. always to our detriment. i say as they cometax them. if they don’t want to be taxed let them make or build the product in the u.s. in either event it means jobs and great wealth.......because of tariffs we will be able to start paying down large amounts of the $21 trillion in debt that has been accumulated much by the obama administration while at the same time reducing taxes for our people. at minimum we will make much better trade deals for our country!fake news reporting a complete fabrication that i am concerned about the meeting my wonderful son donald had in trump tower. this was a meeting to get information on an opponent totally legal and done all the time in politics - and it went nowhere. i did not know about it!...why aren’t mueller and the 17 angry democrats looking at the meetings concerning the fake dossier and all of the lying that went on in the fbi and doj? this

to do with the rigged witch hunt - but that is why we call them fake news!presidential approval numbers are very good - strong economy military and just about everything else. better numbers than

doing what they love...........be happy be cool! a football game that fans are paying soooo much money to watch and enjoy is no place to protest. most of that money goes to the players anyway. find another way to protest. stand proudly for your national anthem or be suspended without pay!i have just authorized a doubling of tariffs on steel and aluminum with respect to turkey as their currency

the fake news media refuses to report is lowlife christopher steele’s many meetings with deputy a.g. bruce ohr and his beautiful wife nelly. it was fusion gps that hired steele to write the phony  discredited dossier paid for by crooked hillary  the dnc........do you believe nelly worked for fusion and her husband still works for the department of “justice.” i have never seen anything so rigged in my life. our a.g. is scared stiff and missing in action. it is all starting to be revealed - not pretty. ig report soon?  witch hunt!hundreds of bikers for trump just joined me at bedminster. quite a scene - great people who truly love our country!.@judgejeanine  “bob mueller isn’t your whole investigation premised on a fake dossier paid for by hillary created by a man who hates donald trump

overseas. great! most other companies are coming in our direction including harley competitors. a really bad move! u.s. will soon have a level playing field or better.“seems like the department of justice (and fbi) had a program to keep donald trump from becoming president”. @darrellissa  @foxandfriends  if this had happened to the other side everybody involved would be in jail. this is a media coverup of the biggest story of our time.wacky omarosa who got fired 3 times on the apprentice now got fired for the last time. she never made it never will. she begged me for a job tears in her eyes i said ok. people in the white house hated her. she was vicious but not smart. i would rarely see her but heard....while i know it’s “not presidential” to take on a lowlife like omarosa and while i would rather not be doing so this is a modern day form of communication and i know the fake news media will be working overtime to make even wacky omarosa look legitimate as possible. sorry!the very unpopular governor of ohio (and failed presidential candidate) @johnkasich hurt troy balderson’s recent win by tamping down enthusiasm for an otherwise great candidate. even kasich’s lt. governor lost gov. race because of his unpopularity. credit to troy on the big win!agent peter strzok was just fired from the fbi - finally. the list of bad players in the fbi  doj gets longer  longer. based on the fact that strzok was in charge of the witch hunt will it be dropped? it is a total hoax. no collusion no obstruction - i just fight back!just fired agent strzok formerly of the fbi was in charge of

15000 jobs-and so much more. vote for scott on tuesday in the republican primary!.@markburnetttv called to say that there are no tapes of the apprentice where i used such a terrible and disgusting word as attributed by wacky and deranged omarosa. i don’t have that word in my vocabulary and never have. she made it up. look at her many recent quotes saying........such wonderful and powerful things about me - a true champion of civil rights - until she got fired. omarosa had zero credibility with the media (they didn’t want interviews) when she worked in the white house. now that she says bad about me they will talk to her. fake news!tom fitton of judicial watch: “the strzok firing is as much about the mueller operation as anything else. there would be no mueller special councel to investigate so called collusion but for the machinations of strzok  his colleagues at the top levels of the fbi. we know this.......guy was corrupt and had anti-trump animus. strzok and others at the fbi should be criminally investigated for the way the conducted this investigation. instead mueller is pretending nothing went wrong. he used strzok he used the clinton dnc dossier...the whole thing........should be shut down. the strzok firing shows that the fundamental underpinnings of the investigation were corrupt. it should be shut down by the courts or by honest prosecutors.” thank you judicial watch i couldn’t have said it better myself!lou dobbs: “this cannot go forward...this special councel with all of his conflicts with his 17 angry democrats without any evidence of collusion by the trump campaign and russia. the dems are the ones who should be investigated.” thank you lou so true!when you give a crazed crying lowlife a break and give her a job at the white house

strength!bruce ohr of the “justice” department (can you believe he is still there) is accused of helping disgraced christopher steele “find dirt on trump.” ohr’s wife nelly was in on the act big time - worked for fusion gps on fake dossier. @foxandfriends“they were all in on it clear hillary clinton and frame donald trump for things he didn’t do.” gregg jarrett on @foxandfriends  if we had a real attorney general this witch hunt would never have been started! looking at the wrong people.fired fbi agent peter strzok is a fraud as is the rigged investigation he started. there was no collusion or obstruction with russia and everybody including the democrats know it. the only collusion and obstruction was by crooked hillary the democrats and the dnc!strzok started the illegal rigged witch hunt - why isn’t this so-called “probe” ended immediately? why aren’t these angry and conflicted democrats instead looking at crooked hillary?lou dobbs: “this cannot go forward...this special counsel with all of his conflicts with his 17 angry democrats without any evidence of collusion by the trump campaign and russia. the dems are the ones who should be investigated.” thank you lou so true!great

crooked hillary and the democrats. all of the resignations and corruption yet heavily conflicted bob mueller refuses to even look in that direction. what about the brennan comey mccabe strzok lies to congress or crooked’s emails!the failing new york times wrote a story that made it seem like the white house councel had turned on the president when in fact it is just the opposite -  the two fake reporters knew this. this is why the fake news media has become the enemy of the people. so bad for america!some members of the media are very angry at the fake story in the new york times. they actually called to complain and apologize - a big step forward. from the day i announced the times has been fake news and with their disgusting new board member it will only get worse!study the late joseph mccarthy because we are now in period with mueller and his gang that make joseph mccarthy look like a baby! rigged witch hunt!disgraced and discredited bob mueller and his whole group of angry democrat thugs spent over 30 hours with the white house councel only with my approval for purposes of transparency. anybody needing that much time when they know there is no russian collusion is just someone........looking for trouble. they are enjoying ruining people’s lives and refuse to look at the real corruption on the democrat side - the lies the firings the deleted emails and soooo much more! mueller’s angry dems are looking to impact the election. they are a national disgrace!where’s the collusion? they made up a phony crime called collusion and when there was no collusion they say there was obstruction (of a phony crime that never existed). if you fight back or say anything bad about the rigged witch hunt they scream obstruction!i hope john brennan the worst cia director in our country’s history brings a lawsuit. it will then be very easy to get all of his records texts emails and documents to show not only the poor job he did but how he was involved with the mueller rigged witch hunt. he won’t sue!everybody wants to keep their security clearance it’s worth great prestige and big dollars even board seats and that is why certain people are coming forward to protect brennan. it certainly isn’t because of the good job he did! he is a political “hack.”will bruce ohr whose family received big money for helping to create the phony dirty and discredited dossier ever be fired from the jeff sessions  “justice” department? a total joke!“bruce ohr is at the center of false allegations which led to a multi-million dollar investigation into what apparently didn’t happen.” darrell issa house oversight. we can take out the word “apparently.”  @foxnewsit is outrageous that poisonous synthetic heroin fentanyl comes pouring into the u.s. postal system from china. we can and must end this now! the senate should pass the stop act – and firmly stop this poison from killing our children and destroying our country. no more delay!just watched former intelligence official phillip mudd become totally unglued and weird while debating wonderful @parisdennard over brennan’s security clearance. dennard destroyed him but mudd is in no mental condition to have such a clearance. should be revoked? @seanhannitywill be going to the great state of west virginia on tuesday night to campaign  do a rally speech for a hard working and spectacular person a.g. patrick morrisey who is running for the u.s. senate. patrick has great energy  stamina-i need his vote to maga. total endorsement!a blue wave means crime and open borders. a red wave means safety and strength!even james clapper has admonished john brennan for having gone totally off the rails. maybe clapper is being nice to me so he doesn’t lose his security clearance for lying to congress!fake news of which there is soooo much (this time the very tired new yorker) falsely reported that i was going to take the extraordinary step of denying intelligence briefings to president obama. never discussed or thought of!i am sorry to have to reiterate that there are serious and unpleasant consequences to crossing the border into the united states illegally! if there were no serious consequences our country would be overrun with people trying to get in and our system could not handle it!big rally tonight in west virginia. patrick morrisey is running a great race for u.s. senate. i have done so much for west virginia against all odds and having patrick a real fighter by my side would make things so much easier. see you later. clean coal!!!!bill deblasio the high taxing mayor

would strongly suggest that you don’t retain the services of michael cohen!i feel very badly for paul manafort and his wonderful family. “justice” took a 12 year old tax case among other things applied tremendous pressure on him and unlike michael cohen he refused to “break” - make up stories in order to get a “deal.” such respect for a brave man!a large number of counts ten could not even be decided in the paul manafort case. witch hunt!michael cohen plead guilty to two counts of campaign finance violations that are not a crime. president obama had a big campaign finance violation and it was easily settled!i will be interviewed on @foxandfriends by @ainsleyearhardt tomorrow from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m.  enjoy!the only thing that i have done wrong is to win an election that was expected to be won by crooked hillary clinton and the democrats. the problem is they forgot to campaign in numerous states!i have asked secretary of state @mikepompeo4usa to closely study the south africa land and farm seizures and expropriations and the large scale killing of farmers. “south african government is now seizing land from white farmers.” @tuckercarlson  @foxnewsi have asked

executive. but virtually everybody is saying this  when our trade deals are made  cost cutting done you haven’t seen anything yet!  @drudge_reportour economy is setting records on virtually every front - probably the best our country has ever done. tremendous value created since the election. the world is respecting us again! companies are moving back to the u.s.a.“department of justice will

hear fake news like cnn whose ratings have suffered gravely. people have to figure out what is real and what is not without censorship!...additionally because of our much tougher trading stance with china i do not believe they are helping with the process of denuclearization as they once were (despite the un sanctions which are in place)......secretary pompeo looks forward to going to north korea in the near future most likely after our trading relationship with china is resolved. in the meantime i would like to send my warmest regards and respect to chairman kim. i look forward to seeing him soon!congratulations to new australian prime minister scott morrison. there are no greater friends than the united states and australia!michaels cohen’s attorney clarified the record saying his client does not know if president trump knew about the trump tower meeting (out of which came nothing!). the answer is that i did not know about the meeting. just another phony story by the fake news media!jeff sessions said he wouldn’t allow politics to influence him only because he doesn’t understand what is happening underneath his command position. highly conflicted bob mueller and his gang of 17 angry dems are having a field day as real corruption goes untouched. no collusion!.@lindseygrahamsc  “every president deserves an attorney general they have confidence in. i believe every president has a right to their cabinet these are not lifetime appointments. you serve at the pleasure of the president.”big story out that the fbi ignored tens of thousands of crooked hillary emails many of

salt  everyone should do the same. multiple sources but almost every one of them has come out and discredited the claims made by woodward. you cannot take this book too seriously.” katelyn caralle washington examiner“it is mostly anonymous sources in here why should anyone trust you? general mattis general kelly said it’s not true.” @savannahguthrie  @todayshow  bob woodward is a liar who is like a dem operative prior to the midterms. he was caught cold even by nbc.the economy is soooo good perhaps the best in our country’s history (remember it’s the economy stupid!) that the democrats

but the world is watching and they get it completely.“eric holder could be running the justice department right now and it would be behaving no differently than it is.” @loudobbsrudy giuliani did a great job as mayor of nyc during the period of september 11th. his leadership bravery and skill must never be forgotten. rudy is a true warrior!17 years since september 11th!“you know who’s at fault for this more than anyone else comey because he leaked information and laundered it through a professor at columbia law school. shame on that professor and shame on comey. he snuck the information to a law professor who collaborated with him in............giving the information and causing the appointment of a special c without having the courage of his own convictions.....”  alan dershowitz   @tuckercarlson   in other words the whole thing was illegally and very unfairly set up?crazy maxine waters: “after we impeach trump we’ll go after mike pence. we’ll get him.”  @foxnews  where are the

got a pluses for our recent hurricane work in texas and florida (and did an unappreciated great job in puerto rico even though an inaccessible island with very poor electricity and a totally incompetent mayor of san juan). we are ready for the big one that is coming!hurricane florence is looking even bigger than anticipated. it will be arriving soon. fema first responders and law

hurricanes that hit puerto rico. when i left the island after the storm had hit they had anywhere from 6 to 18 deaths. as time went by it did not go up by much. then a long time later they started to report really large numbers like 3000........this was done by the democrats in order to make me look as bad as possible when i was successfully raising billions of dollars to help rebuild puerto rico.

imperative and the dems are a no. not good!john kerry had illegal meetings with the very hostile iranian regime which can only serve to undercut our great work to the detriment of the american people.

out before the storm. so when did people start dying? at what point do you recognize that what they are doing is a political agenda couched in the nice language of journalism?”  @geraldorivera“the story of puerto rico is the rebuilding that has occurred. the president has done an extraordinary job of cleanup rebuilding electrical stuff and everything else.”  @edrollins   “the people of puerto rico have one of the most corrupt governments in our country.” @loudobbsgreat job fema first responders and law enforcement - not easy very dangerous tremendous talent. america is proud of you. keep

hurricane took place. over many months it went to 64 people. then like magic “3000 people killed.” they hired........gwu research to tell them how many people had died in puerto rico (how would they not know this?). this method was never done with previous hurricanes because other jurisdictions know how many people were killed. fifty times last original number - no way!when president obama said

country. with open borders which the democrats want we have nothing but crime! finish the wall!five deaths have been recorded thus far with regard to hurricane florence! deepest sympathies and warmth go out to the families and friends of the victims. may god be with them!the illegal mueller witch hunt continues in search of a crime. there was never collusion with russia except by the clinton campaign so the 17 angry democrats are looking at anything they can find. very unfair and bad for the country. also not allowed under the law!fema first responders and law enforcement are working really hard on hurricane florence. as the storm begins to finally recede they will kick into an even higher gear. very professional!just watched sunday morning futures with @mariabartiromo on

unnoticeable. if countries will not make fair deals with us they will be “tariffed!”our steel industry is the talk of the world. it has been given new life and is thriving. billions of dollars is being spent on new plants all around the country!“lisa page testimony- no evidence of collusion before mueller appointment.” @foxnews by catherine herridge. therefore the case should never have been

stuff!china has openly stated that they are actively trying to impact and change our election by attacking our farmers ranchers and industrial workers because of their loyalty to me. what china does not understand is that these people are great patriots and fully understand that..........china has been taking advantage of the united states on trade for many years. they also know that i am the one that knows how to stop it. there will be great and fast economic retaliation against china if our farmers ranchers and/or industrial workers are targeted!right now everybody is saying what a great job we are doing with hurricane florence – and they are 100% correct. but don’t be fooled at some point in the near future the democrats will start ranting......that fema our military and our first

done something that makes it much harder to join - they have stifled growth to a point where it is obvious to all. a few weeks ago it was a rocket ship now it is a blimp! total bias?republicans are

the enemy of the people.” wrong! i said that the “fake news (media) is the enemy of the people” a very big difference. when you give out false information - not good!check out tweets from last two days. i refer to fake news media when mentioning enemy of the people - but dishonest reporters use only the word “media.” the people of our great country are angry and disillusioned at receiving so much fake news. they get it and fully understand!.@troybalderson is doing a great job as congressman from ohio. we need him in d.c. vote for troy - he has my total endorsement!.@troy_balderson is

good one. companies earnings are great!so-called birthright citizenship which costs our country billions of dollars and is very unfair to our citizens will be ended one way or the other. it is not

of classified information and much else at the senate level. two can play that game!in all fairness nancy pelosi deserves to be chosen speaker of the house by the democrats. if they give her a hard time perhaps we will add some republican votes. she has earned this great honor!according to nbc news voters nationwide disapprove of the so-called mueller investigation (46%) more than they approve

back in play!? this is an embarrassment to our country and to democracy!in the 2016 election i was winning by so much in florida that broward county which was very late with vote tabulation and probably getting ready to do a “number” couldn’t do it because not enough people live in broward for them to falsify a victory!thank you @marcorubio for helping to expose the potential corruption going on with respect to election theft in broward and palm beach counties. the world is now watching closely!just out — in arizona signatures don’t match. electoral corruption - call for a new

thought of by @senjoniernst senator @chuckgrassley ambassador @terrybranstad leonard leo of federalist society and many more. i feel certain he will make an outstanding acting attorney general!there is no reason for these massive deadly and costly forest fires in california except that forest management is so poor. billions of dollars are given each year with so many lives lost all because of gross mismanagement of the forests. remedy now or no more fed payments!i am in paris getting ready to celebrate the end of world war one. is there anything better to celebrate than the end of a war in particular that one which was one of the bloodiest and worst of all time?trying to steal two big elections in florida! we are watching closely!these california fires are expanding very very quickly (in some cases 80-100 acres a minute). if people don’t evacuate quickly they risk being overtaken by the fire. please listen to evacuation orders from state and local officials!with proper forest management we can stop the devastation constantly going on in california. get smart!beautiful ceremony today in paris commemorating the end of world war one. many world leaders in attendance. thank you to @emmanuelmacron president of france! now off to suresnes american cemetery to make speech in honor of our great heroes! then back to the u.s.a.just returned from france where much was accomplished in my meetings with world leaders. never easy bringing up the fact that the u.s. must be treated fairly which it hasn’t on both military and trade. we pay for large portions of other countries military protection.............hundreds of billions of dollars for the great privilege of losing hundreds of billions of dollars with these same countries on trade. i told them that this situation cannot continue - it is and always has been ridiculously unfair to the united states. massive amounts..........of money spent on protecting other countries and we get nothing but trade deficits and losses. it is time that these very rich countries either pay the united states for its great military protection or protect themselves...and trade must be made free and fair!the florida election should be called in favor of rick scott and ron desantis in that large numbers of new ballots showed up out of nowhere and many ballots are missing or forged. an honest vote count is no longer possible-ballots massively infected. must go with election night!the prospect of presidential harassment by the dems is causing the stock market big headaches!the california fire fighters fema and  first responders are amazing and very brave. thank you and god bless you all!american cable association has big problems with comcast. they say that comcast routinely violates antitrust laws. “these guys are acting much worse and have much more potential for damage to consumers than anything att-time warner would do.” charlie gasparinohopefully saudi arabia and opec will not be cutting oil production. oil prices should be much lower based on supply!i just approved an expedited request for a major disaster declaration for the state of california. wanted to respond quickly in order to alleviate some of the incredible suffering going on. i am with you all the way. god bless all of the victims and families affected.emmanuel macron suggests building its own army to protect europe against the u.s. china and russia. but it was germany in world wars one  two - how did that work out for france? they were starting to learn german in paris before the u.s. came along. pay for nato or not!on trade france makes excellent wine but so does the u.s. the problem is that france makes it very hard for the u.s. to sell its wines into france and charges big tariffs whereas the u.s. makes it easy for french wines and charges very small tariffs. not fair must change!the problem is that emmanuel suffers from a very low approval rating in france 26% and an unemployment rate of almost 10%. he was just trying to get onto another subject. by the way there is no country more nationalist than france very proud people-and rightfully so!........by the way when the helicopter couldn’t fly to the first cemetery in france because of almost zero visibility i suggested driving. secret service said no too far from airport  big paris shutdown. speech next day at american cemetary in pouring rain! little reported-fake news!by the way when the helicopter couldn’t fly to the first cemetery in france because of almost zero visibility i suggested driving. secret service said no too far from airport  big paris shutdown. speech next day at american cemetery in pouring rain! little reported-fake news!when will bill nelson concede in florida? the characters running broward and palm beach voting will not be able to “find” enough votes too much spotlight on them now!the story in the new york times concerning north korea developing missile bases is inaccurate. we fully know about the sites being discussed nothing new - and nothing happening out of the normal. just more fake news. i will be the first to let you know if things go bad!not seen in many years america’s steelworkers get a hard-earned raise because of my administration’s policies to help bring back the u.s. steel industry which is critical to our national security. i will always protect america and its workers!was just briefed by @fema_brock and @secretaryzinke who are in california. thank you to the great firefighters first responders and @fema for the incredible job they are doing w/ the california wildfires. our nation appreciates your heroism courage  genius. god bless you all!just spoke to governor jerry brown to let him know that we are with him and the people of california all the way!the white house is running very smoothly and the results for our nation are obviously very good. we are the envy of the world. but anytime i even think about making changes the fake news media goes crazy always seeking to make us look as bad as possible! very dishonest!the inner workings of the mueller investigation are a total mess. they have found no collusion and have gone absolutely nuts. they are screaming and shouting at people horribly threatening them to come up with the answers they want. they are a disgrace to our nation and don’t.......care how many lives the ruin. these are angry people including the highly conflicted bob mueller who worked for obama for 8 years. they won’t even look at all of the bad acts and crimes on the other side. a total witch hunt like no other in american history!universities will someday study what highly conflicted (and not senate approved) bob mueller and his gang of democrat thugs have done to destroy people. why is he protecting crooked hillary comey mccabe lisa page  her lover peter s and all of his friends on the other side?the only “collusion” is that of the democrats with russia and many others. why didn’t the fbi take the server from the dnc? they still don’t have it. check out how biased facebook google and twitter are in favor of the democrats. that’s the real collusion!people are not being told that the republican party is on track to pick up two seats in the u.s. senate and epic victory: 53 to 47. the fake news media only wants to speak of the house were the midterm results were better than other sitting presidents.people are not being told that the republican party is on track to pick up two seats in the u.s. senate and epic victory: 53 to 47. the fake news media only wants to speak of the house where the midterm results were better than other sitting presidents.congratulations to ron desantis on becoming the new governor of florida. against all odds he fought  fought  fought the result being a historic victory. he never gave up and never will. he will be a great governor!congratulations to brian kemp on becoming the new governor of georgia. stacey abrams fought brilliantly and hard - she will have a terrific political future! brian was unrelenting and will become a great governor for the truly wonderful people of georgia!isn’t it ironic that large caravans of people are marching to our border wanting u.s.a. asylum because they are fearful of being in their country - yet they are proudly waving........their country’s flag. can this be possible? yes because it is all a big con and the american taxpayer is paying for it!congratulations to andrew gillum on having run a really tough and competitive race for governor of the great state of florida. he will be a strong democrat warrior long into the future - a force to reckon with!the new york times did a phony story as usual about my relationship with @vp mike pence. they made up sources and refused to ask me the only one that would know for a quote........i can’t imagine any president having a better or closer relationship with their vice president then the two of us. just more fake news the enemy of the people!heading to california with @gopleader kevin mccarthy @replamalfa and @kencalvert. look forward to being with our brave firefighters first responders and @fema along with the many brave people of california. we are with you all the way – god bless you all!so funny to see little adam schitt (d-ca) talking about the fact that acting attorney general matt whitaker was not approved by the senate but not mentioning the fact that bob mueller (who is highly conflicted) was not approved by the senate!the mayor of tijuana mexico just stated that “the city is ill-prepared to handle this many migrants the backlog could last 6 months.” likewise the u.s. is ill-prepared for this invasion and will not stand for it. they are causing crime and big problems in mexico. go home!catch and release is an obsolete term. it is now catch and detain. illegal immigrants trying to come into the u.s.a. often proudly flying the flag of their nation as they ask for u.s. asylum will be detained or turned away. dems must approve border security  wall now!from day one rick scott never wavered. he was a great governor and will be even a greater senator in representing the people of florida. congratulations to rick on having waged such a courageous and successful campaign!of course we should have captured osama bin laden long before we did. i pointed him out in my book just before the attack on the world trade center. president clinton famously missed his shot. we paid pakistan billions of dollars  they never told us he was living there. fools!......we no longer pay pakistan the $billions because they would take our money and do nothing for us bin laden being a prime example afghanistan being another. they were just one of many countries that take from the united states without giving anything in return. that’s ending!i hope the discovery and eventual recovery of the argentine submarine san juan brings needed closure to the wonderful families of those brave missing sailors. i look forward to hearing more from my friend president @mauriciomacri in argentina later this month.so-called comedian michelle wolf bombed so badly last year at the white house correspondents’ dinner that this year for the first time in decades they will have an author instead of a comedian. good first step in comeback of a dying evening and tradition! maybe i will go?america first!oil prices getting lower. great! like a big tax cut for america and the world. enjoy! $54 was just $82. thank you to saudi arabia but let’s go lower!make america great again!great new book out “mad politics: keeping your sanity in a world gone crazy” by @realdrgina loudon. go out and get your copy today — a great read!sorry chief justice john roberts but you do indeed have “obama judges” and they have a much different point of view than the people who are charged with the safety of our country. it would be great if the 9th circuit was indeed an “independent judiciary” but if it is why...........are so many opposing view (on border and safety) cases filed there and why are a vast number of those cases overturned. please study the numbers they are shocking. we need protection and security - these rulings are making our country unsafe! very dangerous and unwise!there are a lot of criminals in the caravan. we will stop them. catch and detain! judicial activism by people who know nothing about security and the safety of our citizens is putting our country in great danger. not good!brutal and extended cold blast could shatter all records - whatever happened to global warming?you just can’t win with the fake news media. a big story today is that because i have pushed so hard and gotten gasoline prices so low more people are driving and i have caused traffic jams throughout our great nation. sorry everyone!“it’s a mean  nasty world out there the middle east in particular. this is a long and historic commitment  one that is absolutely vital to america’s national security.” @secpompeo  i agree 100%. in addition many billions of dollars of purchases made in u.s. big jobs  oil!happy thanksgiving to all!justice roberts can say what he wants but the 9th circuit is a complete  total disaster. it is out of control has a horrible reputation is overturned more than any circuit in the country 79%  is used to get an almost guaranteed result. judges must not legislate security.......and safety at the border or anywhere else. they know nothing about it and are making our country unsafe. our great law enforcement professionals must be allowed to do their job! if not there will be only bedlam chaos injury and death. we want the constitution as written!will be speaking with our great military in different parts of the world through teleconference at 9:00 a.m. eastern. then it will be off to see our coast guard patriots  to thank them for the great job they have been doing especially with the hurricanes. happy thanksgiving!this is the coldest weather in the history of the thanksgiving day parade in nyc and one of the coldest thanksgivings on record!our highly trained security professionals are not allowed to do their job on the border because of the judicial activism and interference by the 9th circuit. nevertheless they are working hard to make america a safer place though hard to do when anybody filing a lawsuit wins!republicans and democrats must come together finally with a major border security package which will include funding for the wall. after 40 years of talk it is finally time for action. fix the border for once and for all now!really good criminal justice reform has a true shot at major bipartisan support. @senatemajldr mitch mcconnell and @senchuckschumer have a real chance to do something so badly needed in our country. already past with big vote in house. would be a major victory for all!really good criminal justice reform has a true shot at major bipartisan support. @senatemajldr mitch mcconnell and @senschumer have a real chance to do something so badly needed in our country. already passed with big vote in house. would be a major victory for all!i am extremely happy and proud of the job being done by @ustreasury secretary @stevenmnuchin1. the fake news likes to write stories to the contrary quoting phony sources or jealous people but they aren’t true. they never like to ask me for a quote b/c it would kill their story.migrants at the southern border will not be allowed into the united states until their claims are individually approved in court. we only will allow those who come into our country legally. other than that our very strong policy is catch and detain. no “releasing” into the u.s.......all will stay in mexico. if for any reason it becomes necessary we will close our southern border. there is no way that the united states will after decades of abuse put up with this costly and dangerous situation anymore!victor davis hanson was a very good and interesting guest of mark levin on @foxnews. he wrote a highly touted book called “the second world wars” and a new book will soon be coming out called “the case for trump.” recommend both. @marklevinshowi will be in gulfport and tupelo mississippi on monday night doing two rallies for senator hyde-smith who has a very important election on tuesday. she is an outstanding person who is strong on the border crime military our great vets healthcare  the 2nd a. needed in d.c.the large and violent french protests don’t take into account how badly the united states has been treated on trade by the european union or on fair and reasonable payments for our great military protection. both of these topics must be remedied soon.would be very smart if mexico would stop the caravans long before they get to our southern border or if originating countries would not let them form (it is a way they get certain people out of their country and dump in u.s. no longer). dems created this problem. no crossings!so great that oil prices are falling (thank you president t). add that which is like a big tax cut to our other good economic news. inflation down (are you listening fed)!mississippi vote for @cindyhydesmith on tuesday. respected by all. we need her in washington!. thanks!general anthony tata: “president trump is a man of his word  he said he was going to be tough on the border and he is tough on the border. he has rightfully strengthened the border in the face of an unprecedented threat. it’s the right move by president trump.” thanks general!europe has to pay their fair share for military protection. the european union for many years has taken advantage of us on trade and then they don’t live up to their military commitment through nato. things must change fast!clinton foundation donations drop 42% - which shows that they illegally played the power game. they monetized their political influence through the foundation. “during her tenure the state department was put in the service of the clinton foundation.”  andrew mccarthy.@60minutes did a phony story about child separation when they know we had the exact same policy as the obama administration. in fact a picture of children in jails was used by other fake media to show how bad (cruel) we are but it was in 2014 during o years. obama separated........children from parents as did bush etc. because that is the policy and law. i tried to keep them together but the problem is when you do that vast numbers of additional people storm the border. so with obama seperation is fine but with trump it’s not. fake 60 minutes!mexico should move the flag waving migrants many of whom are stone cold criminals back to their countries. do it by plane do it by bus do it anyway you want but they are not coming into the u.s.a. we will close the border permanently if need be. congress fund the wall!when mueller does his final report will he be covering all of his conflicts of interest in a preamble will he be recommending action on all of the crimes of many kinds from those “on the other side”(whatever happened to podesta?) and will he be putting in statements from.........hundreds of people closely involved with my campaign who never met saw or spoke to a russian during this period? so many campaign workers people inside from the beginning ask me why they have not been called (they want to be). there was no collusion  mueller knows it!....and false way. something has to be done including the possibility of the united states starting our own worldwide network to show the world the way we really are great!brad raffensperger will be a fantastic secretary of state for georgia - will work closely with @briankempga. it is really important that you get out and vote for brad - early voting........starts today election is on december 4th. @votebradraff is tough on crime and borders loves our military and vets. he will be great for jobs!the phony witch hunt continues but mueller and his gang of angry dems are only looking at one side not the other. wait until it comes out how horribly  viciously they are treating people ruining lives for them refusing to lie. mueller is a conflicted prosecutor gone rogue........the fake news media builds bob mueller up as a saint when in actuality he is the exact opposite. he is doing tremendous damage to our criminal justice system where he is only looking at one side and not the other. heroes will come of this and it won’t be mueller and his.......terrible gang of angry democrats. look at their past and look where they come from. the now $30000000 witch hunt continues and they’ve got nothing but ruined lives. where is the server? let these terrible people go back to the clinton foundation and “justice” department!polls are open in mississippi. we need cindy hyde-smith in washington. go out and vote. thanks!very disappointed with general motors and their ceo mary barra for closing plants in ohio michigan and maryland. nothing being closed in mexico  china. the u.s. saved general motors and this is the thanks we get! we are now looking at cutting all @gm subsidies including........for electric cars. general motors made a big china bet years ago when they built plants there (and in mexico) - don’t think that bet is going to pay off. i am here to protect america’s workers!the mueller witch hunt is a total disgrace. they are looking at supposedly stolen crooked hillary clinton emails (even though they don’t want to look at the dnc server) but have no interest in the emails that hillary deleted  acid washed after getting a congressional subpoena!brenda snipes in charge of voting in broward county florida was just spotted wearing a beautiful dress with 300 i voted signs on it. just kidding she is a fine very honorable and highly respected voting tactician!congratulations to senator cindy hyde-smith on your big win in the great state of mississippi. we are all very proud of you!while the disgusting fake news is doing everything within their power not to report it that way at least 3 major players are intimating that the angry mueller gang of dems is viciously telling witnesses to lie about facts  they will get relief. this is our joseph mccarthy era!the reason that the small truck business in the u.s. is such a go to favorite is that for many years tariffs of 25% have been put on small trucks coming into our country. it is called the “chicken tax.” if we did that with cars coming in many more cars would be built here..........and g.m. would not be closing their plants in ohio michigan  maryland. get smart congress. also the countries that send us cars have taken advantage of the u.s. for decades. the president has great power on this issue - because of the g.m. event it is being studied now!sebastian gorka a very talented man who i got to know well while he was working at the white house has just written an excellent book “why we fight.” much will be learned from this very good read!so much happening with the now discredited witch hunt. this total hoax will be studied for years!general motors is very counter to what other auto and other companies are doing. big steel is opening and renovating plants all over the country. auto companies are pouring into the u.s. including bmw which just announced a major new plant. the u.s.a. is booming!did you ever see an investigation more in search of a crime? at the same time mueller and the angry democrats aren’t even looking at the atrocious and perhaps subversive crimes that were committed by crooked hillary clinton and the democrats. a total disgrace!when will this illegal joseph mccarthy style witch hunt one that has shattered so many innocent lives ever end-or will it just go on forever? after wasting more than $40000000 (is that possible?) it has proven only one thing-there was no collusion with russia. so ridiculous!billions of dollars are pouring into the coffers of the u.s.a. because of the tariffs being charged to china and there is a long way to go. if companies don’t want to pay tariffs build in the u.s.a. otherwise lets just make our country richer than ever before!based on the fact that the ships and sailors have not been returned to ukraine from russia i have decided it would be best for all parties concerned to cancel my previously scheduled meeting.....@stevescalise has written an absolutely fascinating book (back in the game) on the world of d.c. politics and more. he has experienced so much in a short period of time. few people have had his bravery or courage and he has come all the way back. a big power and great person!.@stephenmoore and arthur laffer two very talented men have just completed an incredible book on my economic policies or as they call it #trumponomics........they have really done a great job in capturing my long-held views and ideas. this book is on sale now - a terrific read of a really interesting subject!with all of the new books coming out you can\\'t forget two of the great originals written by @greggjarrett and @judgejeanine pirro. their books both went to #1. go get them now the phony witch hunt is well explained!as rnc chair ronna mcdaniel oversaw history defying gains in the senate and unprecedented fundraising strength. i have asked her to serve another term for my 2020 re-elect because there is no one better for the job!“this demonstrates the robert mueller and his partisans have no evidence not a whiff of collusion between trump and the russians. russian project legal. trump tower meeting (son don) perfectly legal. he wasn’t involved with hacking.”     gregg jarrett.  a total witch hunt!alan dershowitz: “these are not crimes. he (mueller) has no authority to be a roving commissioner. i don’t see any evidence of crimes.”  this is an illegal hoax that should be ended immediately. mueller refuses to look at the real crimes on the other side. where is the ig report?oh i get it! i am a very good developer happily living my life when i see our country going in the wrong direction (to put it mildly). against all odds i decide to run for president  continue to run my business-very legal  very cool talked about it on the campaign trail.......lightly looked at doing a building somewhere in russia. put up zero money zero guarantees and didn’t do the project. witch hunt!just signed one of the most important and largest trade deals in u.s. and world history. the united states mexico and canada worked so well together in crafting this great document. the terrible nafta will soon be gone. the usmca will be fantastic for all!to the great people of alaska. you have been hit hard by a “big one.” please follow the directions of the highly trained professionals who are there to help you. your federal government will spare no expense. god bless you all!great reviews on the usmca - sooo much better than nafta!watch @seanhannity on @foxnews now. enjoy!president george h.w. bush led a long successful and beautiful life.  whenever i was with him i saw his absolute joy for life and true pride in his family. his accomplishments were great from beginning to end. he was a truly wonderful man and will be missed by all!i was very much looking forward to having a press conference just prior to leaving argentina because we have had such great success in our dealing with various countries and their leaders at the g20........however out of respect for the bush family and former president george h.w. bush we will wait until after the funeral to have a press conference.china has agreed to reduce and remove tariffs on cars coming into china from the u.s. currently the tariff is 40%.my meeting in argentina with president xi of china was an extraordinary one. relations with china have taken a big leap forward! very good things will happen. we are dealing from great strength but china likewise has much to gain if and when a deal is completed. level the field!farmers will be a a very big and fast beneficiary of our deal with china. they intend to start purchasing agricultural product immediately. we make the finest and cleanest product in the world and that is what china wants. farmers i love you!president xi and i have a very strong and personal relationship. he and i are the only two people that can bring about massive and very positive change on trade and far beyond between our two great nations. a solution for north korea is a great thing for china and all!i am certain that at some time in the future president xi and i together with president putin of russia will start talking about a meaningful halt to what has become a major and uncontrollable arms race. the u.s. spent 716 billion dollars this year. crazy!we would save billions of dollars if the democrats would give us the votes to build the wall. either way people will not be allowed into our country illegally! we will close the entire southern border if necessary. also stop the drugs!“michael cohen asks judge for no prison time.” you mean he can do all of the terrible unrelated to trump things having to do with fraud big loans taxis etc. and not serve a long prison term? he makes up stories to get a great  already reduced deal for himself and get.........his wife and father-in-law (who has the money?) off scott free. he lied for this outcome and should in my opinion serve a full and complete sentence.“i will never testify against trump.” this statement was recently made by roger stone essentially stating that he will not be forced by a rogue and out of control prosecutor to make up lies and stories about “president trump.” nice to know that some people still have “guts!”bob mueller (who is a much different man than people think) and his out of control band of angry democrats don’t want the truth they only want lies. the truth is very bad for their mission!looking forward to being with the bush family to pay my respects to president george h.w. bush.congratulations to newly inaugurated mexican president @lopezobrador_. he had a tremendous political victory with the great support of the mexican people. we will work well together for many years to come!looking forward to being with the wonderful bush family at blair house today. the former first lady will be coming over to the white house this morning to be given a tour of the christmas decorations by melania. the elegance  precision of the last two days have been remarkable!the negotiations with china have already started. unless extended they will end 90 days from the date of our wonderful and very warm dinner with president xi in argentina. bob lighthizer will be working closely with steve mnuchin larry kudlow wilbur ross and peter navarro...........on seeing whether or not a real deal with china is actually possible. if it is we will get it done. china is supposed to start buying agricultural product and more immediately. president xi and i want this deal to happen and it probably will. but if not remember..........i am a tariff man. when people or countries come in to raid the great wealth of our nation i want them to pay for the privilege of doing so. it will always be the best way to max out our economic power. we are right now taking in $billions in tariffs. make america rich again.....but if a fair deal is able to be made with china one that does all of the many things we know must be finally done i will happily sign. let the negotiations begin. make america great again!could somebody please explain to the democrats (we need their votes) that our country losses 250 billion dollars a year on illegal immigration not including the terrible drug flow. top border security including a wall is $25 billion. pays for itself in two months. get it done!i am glad that my friend @emmanuelmacron and the protestors in paris have agreed with the conclusion i reached two years ago. the paris agreement is fatally flawed because it raises the price of energy for responsible countries while whitewashing some of the worst polluters........in the world. i want clean air and clean water and have been making great strides in improving america’s environment. but american taxpayers – and american workers – shouldn’t pay to clean up others countries’ pollution.we are either going to have a real deal with china or no deal at all - at which point we will be charging major tariffs against chinese product being shipped into the united states. ultimately i believe we will be making a deal - either now or into the future.........china does not want tariffs!“china officially echoed president donald trump’s optimism over bilateral trade talks. chinese officials have begun preparing to restart imports of u.s. soybeans  liquified natural gas the first sign confirming the claims of president donald trump and the white house that...........china had agreed to start “immediately” buying u.s. products.” @businessvery strong signals being sent by china once they returned home from their long trip including stops from argentina. not to sound naive or anything but i believe president xi meant every word of what he said at our long and hopefully historic meeting. all subjects discussed!one of the very exciting things to come out of my meeting with president xi of china is his promise to me to criminalize the sale of deadly fentanyl coming into the united states. it will now be considered a “controlled substance.” this could be a game changer on what is............considered to be the worst and most dangerous addictive and deadly substance of them all. last year over 77000 people died from fentanyl. if china cracks down on this “horror drug” using the death penalty for distributors and pushers the results will be incredible!looking forward to being with the bush family. this is not a funeral this is a day of celebration for a great man who has led a long and distinguished life. he will be missed!hopefully opec will be keeping oil flows as is not restricted. the world does not want to see or need higher oil prices!doug wead a truly great presidential historian had a wonderful take on a very beautiful moment in history the funeral service today of president bush. doug was able to brilliantly cover some very important and interesting periods of time! @loudobbswithout the phony russia witch hunt and with all that we have accomplished in the last almost two years (tax  regulation cuts judge’s military vets etc.) my approval rating would be at 75% rather than the 50% just reported by rasmussen. it’s called presidential harassment!my thoughts and prayers are with the @usmc crew members who were involved in a mid-air collision off the coast of japan. thank you to @usforcesjapan for their immediate response and rescue efforts. whatever you need we are here for you. @iiimefdoes the fake news media ever mention the fact that republicans with the very important help of my campaign rallies won the united states senate 53 to 47? all i hear is that the open border dems won the house. senate alone approves judges  others. big republican win!statement from china: “the teams of both sides are now having smooth communications and good cooperation with each other. we are full of confidence that an agreement can be reached within the next 90 days.” i agree!jerome corsi: ”this is not justice this is not america. this is a political prosecution. the special prosecutor (counsel) to get this plea deal demanded i lie and violate the law. they’re the criminals.” he is not alone. 17 angry dems. people forced to lie. sad!  @trish_regantrish_regan:  “did the fbi follow protocol to obtain the fisa warrant? i don’t think so. the dossier was opposition research funded by opponents. don’t use government resources to take down political foes. weaponizing government for gain.” is this really america? witch hunt!fake news - the enemy of the people!arizona together with our military and border patrol is bracing for a massive surge at a non-walled area. we will not let them through. big danger. nancy and chuck must approve boarder security and the wall!robert mueller and leakin’ lyin’ james comey are best friends just one of many mueller conflicts of interest. and bye the way wasn’t the woman in charge of prosecuting jerome corsi (who i do not know) in charge of “legal” at the corrupt clinton foundation? a total witch hunt.......will robert mueller’s big time conflicts of interest be listed at the top of his republicans only report. will andrew weissman’s horrible and vicious prosecutorial past be listed in the report. he wrongly destroyed people’s lives took down great companies only to be.............overturned 9-0 in the united states supreme court. doing same thing to people now. will all of the substantial  many contributions made by the 17 angry democrats to the campaign of crooked hillary be listed in top of report. will the people that worked for the clinton........foundation be listed at the top of the report? will the scathing document written about lyin’ james comey by the man in charge of the case rod rosenstein (who also signed the fisa warrant) be a big part of the report? isn’t rod therefore totally conflicted? will all of....it has been incorrectly reported that rudy giuliani and others will not be doing a counter to the mueller report. that is fake news. already 87 pages done but obviously cannot complete until we see the final witch hunt report.we will be doing a major counter report to the mueller report. this should never again be allowed to happen to a future president of the united states!i am pleased to announce that i will be nominating the honorable william p. barr for the position of attorney general of the united states. as the former ag for george h.w. bush........and one of the most highly respected lawyers and legal minds in the country he will be a great addition to our team. i look forward to having him join our very successful administration!mike pompeo is doing a great job i am very proud of him. his predecessor rex tillerson didn’t have the mental capacity needed. he was dumb as a rock and i couldn’t get rid of him fast enough. he was lazy as hell. now it is a whole new ballgame great spirit at state!hopefully mitch mcconnell will ask for a vote on criminal justice reform. it is extremely popular and has strong bipartisan support. it will also help a lot of people save taxpayer dollars and keep our communities safe. go for it mitch!it is being reported that leakin\\' james comey was told by department of justice attorneys not to answer the most important questions. total bias and corruption at the highest levels of previous administration. force him to answer the questions under oath!totally clears the president. thank you!the paris agreement isn’t working out so well for paris. protests and riots all over france. people do not want to pay large sums of money much to third world countries (that are questionably run) in order to maybe protect the environment. chanting “we want trump!” love france.the idea of a european military didn’t work out too well in w.w. i or 2. but the u.s. was there for you and always will be. all we ask is that you pay your fair share of nato. germany is paying 1% while the u.s. pays 4.3% of a much larger gdp - to protect europe. fairness!after two years and millions of pages of documents (and a cost of over $30000000) no collusion!i am pleased to announce my nomination of four-star general mark milley chief of staff of the united states army – as the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff replacing general joe dunford who will be retiring........i am thankful to both of these incredible men for their service to our country! date of transition to be determined.very sad day  night in paris. maybe it’s time to end the ridiculous and extremely expensive paris agreement and return money back to the people in the form of lower taxes? the u.s. was way ahead of the curve on that and the only major country where emissions went down last year!watched da nang dick blumenthal on television spewing facts almost as accurate as his bravery in vietnam (which he never saw). as the bullets whizzed by da nang dicks head as he was saving soldiers........left and right he then woke up from his dream screaming that he lied. next time i go to vietnam i will ask “the dick” to travel with me!on 245  occasions former fbi director james comey told house investigators he didn’t know didn’t recall or couldn’t remember things when asked. opened investigations on 4 americans (not 2) - didn’t know who signed off and didn’t know christopher steele. all lies!leakin’ james comey must have set a record for who lied the most to congress in one day. his friday testimony was so untruthful! this whole deal is a rigged fraud headed up by dishonest people who would do anything so that i could not become president. they are now exposed!the trump administration has accomplished more than any other u.s. administration in its first two (not even) years of existence  we are having a great time doing it! all of this despite the fake news media which has gone totally out of its mind-truly the enemy of the people!“democrats can’t find a smocking gun tying the trump campaign to russia after james comey’s testimony. no smocking gun...no collusion.” @foxnews  that’s because there was no collusion. so now the dems go to a simple private transaction wrongly call it a campaign contribution.......which it was not (but even if it was it is only a civil case like obama’s - but it was done correctly by a lawyer and there would not even be a fine. lawyer’s liability if he made a mistake not me). cohen just trying to get his sentence reduced. witch hunt!james comey’s behind closed doors testimony reveals that “there was not evidence of campaign collusion” with russia when he left the fbi. in other words the witch hunt is illegal and should never have been started!“former fbi director james comey under fire for his testimony acknowledging he knew that the democrats paid for that phony trump dossier.” @loudobbs  details on tuesday night.despite the large caravans that were forming and heading to our country people have not been able to get through our newly built walls makeshift walls  fences or border patrol officers  military. they are now staying in mexico or going back to their original countries............ice border patrol and our military have done a fantastic job of securing our southern border. a great wall would be however a far easier  less expensive solution. we have already built large new sections  fully renovated others making them like new. the democrats.........however for strictly political reasons and because they have been pulled so far left do not want border security. they want open borders for anyone to come in. this brings large scale crime and disease. our southern border is now secure and will remain that way............i look forward to my meeting with chuck schumer  nancy pelosi. in 2006 democrats voted for a wall and they were right to do so. today they no longer want border security. they will fight it at all cost and nancy must get votes for speaker. but the wall will get built.......people do not yet realize how much of the wall including really effective renovation has already been built. if the democrats do not give us the votes to secure our country the military will build the remaining sections of the wall. they know how important it is!fake news has it purposely wrong. many over ten are vying for and wanting the white house chief of staff position. why wouldn’t someone want one of the truly great and meaningful jobs in washington. please report news correctly. thank you!james comey just totally exposed his partisan stance by urging his fellow democrats to take back the white house in 2020. in other words he is and has been a democrat. comey had no right heading the fbi at any time but especially after his mind exploded!“i don’t care what you think of the president...it cannot bleed over to the fbi...comey is confirming there is bias in the fbi...” -chris sweckerthanks to leader mcconnell for agreeing to bring a senate vote on criminal justice this week! these historic changes will make communities safer and save tremendous taxpayers dollars. it brings much needed hope to many families during the holiday season.another very bad terror attack in france. we are going to strengthen our borders even more. chuck and nancy must give us the votes to get additional border security!the democrats and president obama gave iran 150 billion dollars and got nothing but they can’t give 5 billion dollars for national security and a wall?i often stated “one way or the other mexico is going to pay for the wall.” this has never changed. our new deal with mexico (and canada) the usmca is so much better than the old very costly  anti-usa nafta deal that just by the money we save mexico is paying for the wall!i never directed michael cohen to break the law. he was a lawyer and he is supposed to know the law. it is called “advice of counsel” and a lawyer has great liability if a mistake is made. that is why they get paid. despite that many campaign finance lawyers have strongly..........stated that i did nothing wrong with respect to campaign finance laws if they even apply because this was not campaign finance. cohen was guilty on many charges unrelated to me but he plead to two campaign charges which were not criminal and of which he probably was not.......guilty even on a civil bases. those charges were just agreed to by him in order to embarrass the president and get a much reduced prison sentence which he did-including the fact that his family was temporarily let off the hook. as a lawyer michael has great liability to me!....guilty even on a civil basis. those charges were just agreed to by him in order to embarrass the president and get a much reduced prison sentence which he did-including the fact that his family was temporarily let off the hook. as a lawyer michael has great liability to me!they gave general flynn a great deal because they were embarrassed by the way he was treated - the fbi said he didn’t lie and they overrode the fbi. they want to scare everybody into making up stories that are not true by catching them in the smallest of misstatements. sad!......witch hunt!if it was a conservative that said what “crazed” mika brzezinski stated on her show yesterday using a certain horrible term that person would be banned permanently from television........she will probably be given a pass despite their terrible ratings. congratulations to @richardgrenell our great ambassador to germany for having the courage to take this horrible issue on!china just announce the there economy is growing much slower than anticipated because of our trade war with them. they have just suspended u.s. tariff hikes. u.s. is doing very well. china wants to make a big and very comprehensive deal. it could happen and rather soon!china just announced that their economy is growing much slower than anticipated because of our trade war with them. they have just suspended u.s. tariff hikes. u.s. is doing very well. china wants to make a big and very comprehensive deal. it could happen and rather soon!many people have asked how we are doing in our negotiations with north korea - i always reply by saying we are in no hurry there is wonderful potential for great economic success for that country........kim jong un sees it better than anyone and will fully take advantage of it for his people. we are doing just fine!i am pleased to announce that mick mulvaney director of the office of management  budget will be named acting white house chief of staff replacing general john kelly who has served our country with distinction. mick has done an outstanding job while in the administration........i look forward to working with him in this new capacity as we continue to make america great again! john will be staying until the end of the year. he is a great patriot and i want to personally thank him for his service!for the record there were many people who wanted to be the white house chief of staff. mick m will do a great job!as i predicted all along obamacare has been struck down as an unconstitutional disaster! now congress must pass a strong law that provides great healthcare and protects pre-existing conditions. mitch and nancy get it done!wow but not surprisingly obamacare was just ruled unconstitutional by a highly respected judge in texas. great news for america!secretary of the interior @ryanzinke will be leaving the administration at the end of the year after having served for a period of almost two years. ryan has accomplished much during his tenure and i want to thank him for his service to our nation..............the trump administration will be announcing the new secretary of the interior next week.never in the history of our country has the “press” been more dishonest than it is today. stories that should be good are bad. stories that should be bad are horrible. many stories like with the real story on russia clinton  the dnc seldom get reported. too bad!the pathetic and dishonest weekly standard run by failed prognosticator bill kristol (who like many others never had a clue) is flat broke and out of business. too bad. may it rest in peace!wow 19000 texts between lisa page and her lover peter s of the fbi in charge of the russia hoax were just reported as being wiped clean and gone. such a big story that will never be covered by the fake news. witch hunt!so where are all the missing text messages between fired fbi agents peter s and the lovely lisa page his lover. just reported that they have been erased and wiped clean. what an outrage as the totally compromised and conflicted witch hunt moves ever so slowly forward. want them!remember michael cohen only became a “rat” after the fbi did something which was absolutely unthinkable  unheard of until the witch hunt was illegally started. they broke into an attorney’s office! why didn’t they break into the dnc to get the server or crooked’s office?judge ken starr former solicitor generel  independent counsel just stated that after two years “there is no evidence or proof of collusion”  further that “there is no evidence that there was a campaign financing violation involving the president.” thank you judge. @foxnewsthe democrats policy of child seperation on the border during the obama administration was far worse than the way we handle it now. remember the 2014 picture of children in cages - the obama years. however if you don’t separate far more people will come. smugglers use the kids!required television watching is last weeks @marthamaccallum interview with the wonderful wife of @rodblagojevich and the @trishregan interview with a jerome corsi. if that doesn’t tell you something about what has been going on in our country nothing will. very sad!required television watching is last weeks @marthamaccallum interview with the wonderful wife of rod blagojevich and the @trish_regan interview with a jerome corsi. if that doesn’t tell you something about what has been going on in our country nothing will. very sad!“it looks here as though general flynn’s defenses are incidental to something larger which is for the prosecution to figure out if it can find a path to donald trump without quite knowing what that crime might be. it stops looking like prosecution and more looking like..........a persecution of the president.”  daniel henninger the wall street journal. thank you people are starting to see and understand what this witch hunt is all about. jeff sessions should be ashamed of himself for allowing this total hoax to get started in the first place!....the russian witch hunt hoax started as the “insurance policy” long before i even got elected is very bad for our country. they are entrapping people for misstatements lies or unrelated things that took place many years ago. nothing to do with collusion. a democrat scam!the deductible which comes with obamacare is so high that it is practically not even useable! hurts families badly. we have a chance working with the democrats to deliver great healthcare! a confirming supreme court decision will lead to great healthcare results for americans!anytime you hear a democrat saying that you can have good boarder security without a wall write them off as just another politician following the party line. time for us to save billions of dollars a year and have at the same time far greater safety and control!it is incredible that with a very strong dollar and virtually no inflation the outside world blowing up around us paris is burning and china way down the fed is even considering yet another interest rate hike. take the victory!anytime you hear a democrat saying that you can have good border security without a wall write them off as just another politician following the party line. time for us to save billions of dollars a year and have at the same time far greater safety and control!today i am making good on my promise to defend our farmers  ranchers from unjustified trade retaliation by foreign nations. i have authorized secretary perdue to implement the 2nd round of market facilitation payments. our economy is stronger than ever–we stand with our farmers!biggest outrage yet in the long winding and highly conflicted mueller witch hunt is the fact that 19000 demanded text messages between peter strzok and his fbi lover lisa page were purposely  illegally deleted. would have explained whole hoax which is now under protest!good luck today in court to general michael flynn. will be interesting to see what he has to say despite tremendous pressure being put on him about russian collusion in our great and obviously highly successful political campaign. there was no collusion!i hope the people over at the fed will read today’s wall street journal editorial before they make yet another mistake. also don’t let the market become any more illiquid than it already is. stop with the 50 b’s. feel the market don’t just go by meaningless numbers. good luck!facebook twitter and google are so biased toward the dems it is ridiculous! twitter in fact has made it much more difficult for people to join @realdonaldtrump. they have removed many names  greatly slowed the level and speed of increase. they have acknowledged-done nothing!illegal immigration costs the united states more than 200 billion dollars a year. how was this allowed to happen?russia dossier reporter now doubts dopey christopher steele’s claims! “when you get into the details of the steele dossier the specific allegations we have not seen the evidence to support them. there’s good grounds to think that some of the more sensational allegations.........will never be proven and are likely false.”  thank you to michael isikoff yahoo for honesty. what this means is that the fisa warrants and the whole russian witch hunt is a fraud and a hoax which should be ended immediately. also it was paid for by crooked hillary  dnc!michael isikoff was the first to report dossier allegations and now seriously doubts the dossier claims. the whole russian collusion thing was a hoax but who is going to restore the good name of so many people whose reputations have been destroyed?congratulations to @marthamcsally on her appointment by governor @dougducey as the great new senator from arizona - i have no doubt she will do a fantastic job!the democrats are saying loud and clear that they do not want to build a concrete wall - but we are not building a concrete wall we are building artistically designed steel slats so that you can easily see through it........it will be beautiful and at the same time give our country the security that our citizens deserve. it will go up fast and save us billions of dollars a month once completed!america is the greatest country in the world and my job is to fight for all citizens even those who have made mistakes. congratulations to the senate on the bi-partisan passing of a historic criminal justice reform bill........this will keep our communities safer and provide hope and a second chance to those who earn it. in addition to everything else billions of dollars will be saved. i look forward to signing this into law!in our country so much money has been poured down the drain for so many years but the democrats fight us like cats and dogs when it comes to spending on boarder security (including a wall) and the military. we won on the military it is being completely rebuilt. we will win...in our country so much money has been poured down the drain for so many years but when it comes to border security and the military the democrats fight to the death. we won on the military which is being completely rebuilt. one way or the other we will win on the wall!we have defeated isis in syria my only reason for being there during the trump presidency.the trump foundation has done great work and given away lots of money both mine and others to great charities over the years - with me taking no fees rent salaries etc. now as usual i am getting slammed by cuomo and the dems in a long running civil lawsuit started by........sleazebag ag eric schneiderman who has since resigned over horrific women abuse when i wanted to close the foundation so as not to be in conflict with politics. shady eric was head of new yorkers for clinton and refused to even look at the corrupt clinton foundation..........in any event it goes on and on  the new ag who is now being replaced by yet another ag (who openly campaigned on a get trump agenda) does little else but rant rave  politic against me. will never be treated fairly by these people - a total double standard of “justice.”col. jim carafano on @ingrahamangle “trump has made the middle east a better place. when trump came into office isis was running amuck in the middle east. over a million refugees poured into western europe - none of that is happening today. that’s all due to trump.”“trump gets no credit for what he’s done in the middle east.”  @ingrahamangle  so true thank you laura!“i’m proud of the president today to hear that he is declaring victory in syria.” senator rand paul.  “i couldn’t agree more with the presidents decision. by definition this is the opposite of an obama decision. senator mike leedoes the usa want to be the policeman of the middle east getting nothing but spending precious lives and trillions of dollars protecting others who in almost all cases do not appreciate what we are doing? do we want to be there forever? time for others to finally fight.........russia iran syria  many others are not happy about the u.s. leaving despite what the fake news says because now they will have to fight isis and others who they hate without us. i am building by far the most powerful military in the world. isis hits us they are doomed!the democrats who know steel slats (wall) are necessary for border security are putting politics over country. what they are just beginning to realize is that i will not sign any of their legislation including infrastructure unless it has perfect border security. u.s.a. wins!with so much talk about the wall people are losing sight of the great job being done on our southern border by border patrol ice and our great military. remember the caravans? well they didn’t get through and none are forming or on their way. border is tight. fake news silent!when i begrudgingly signed the omnibus bill i was promised the wall and border security by leadership. would be done by end of year (now). it didn’t happen! we foolishly fight for border security for other countries - but not for our beloved u.s.a. not good!so hard to believe that lindsey graham would be against saving soldier lives  billions of $$$. why are we fighting for our enemy syria by staying  killing isis for them russia iran  other locals? time to focus on our country  bring our youth back home where they belong!general jim mattis will be retiring with distinction at the end of february after having served my administration as secretary of defense for the past two years. during jim’s tenure tremendous progress has been made especially with respect to the purchase of new fighting........equipment. general mattis was a great help to me in getting allies and other countries to pay their share of military obligations. a new secretary of defense will be named shortly. i greatly thank jim for his service!thank you to our great republican members of congress for your vote to fund border security and the wall. the final numbers were 217-185 and many have said that the enthusiasm was greater than they have ever seen before. so proud of you all. now on to the senate!soon to be speaker nancy pelosi said last week live from the oval office that the republicans didn’t have the votes for border security. today the house republicans voted and won 217-185. nancy does not have to apologize. all i want is great border security!senator mitch mcconnell should fight for the wall and border security as hard as he fought for anything. he will need democrat votes but as shown in the house good things happen. if enough dems don’t vote it will be a democrat shutdown! house republicans were great yesterday!the democrats are trying to belittle the concept of a wall calling it old fashioned. the fact is there is nothing else’s that will work and that has been true for thousands of years. it’s like the wheel there is nothing better. i know tech better than anyone  technology..........on a border is only effective in conjunction with a wall. properly designed and built walls work and the democrats are lying when they say they don’t. in israel the wall is 99.9% successful. will not be any different on our southern border! hundreds of $billions saved!no matter what happens today in the senate republican house members should be very proud of themselves. they flew back to washington from all parts of the world in order to vote for border security and the wall. not one democrat voted yes and we won big. i am very proud of you!the democrats whose votes we need in the senate will probably vote against border security and the wall even though they know it is desperately needed. if the dems vote no there will be a shutdown that will last for a very long time. people don’t want open borders and crime!house republican vote 217-185.shutdown today if democrats do not vote for border security!even president ronald reagan tried for 8 years to build a border wall or fence and was unable to do so. others also have tried. we will get it done one way or the other!mitch use the nuclear option and get it done! our country is counting on you!thank you @stevedaines for being willing to go with the so-called nuclear option in order to win on desperately needed border security! have my total support.there has never been a president who has been tougher (but fair) on china or russia - never just look at the facts. the fake news tries so hard to paint the opposite picture.i’ve done more damage to isis than all recent presidents....not even close!wishing supreme court justice ruth bader ginsburg a full and speedy recovery!i am in the white house working hard. news reports concerning the shutdown and syria are mostly fake. we are negotiating with the democrats on desperately needed border security (gangs drugs human trafficking  more) but it could be a long stay. on syria we were originally.......going to be there for three months and that was seven years ago - we never left. when i became president isis was going wild. now isis is largely defeated and other local countries including turkey should be able to easily take care of whatever remains. we’re coming home!will be having lunch in white house residence with large group concerning border security.the crisis of illegal activity at our southern border is real and will not stop until we build a great steel barrier or wall. let work begin!i won an election said to be one of the greatest of all time based on getting out of endless  costly foreign wars  also based on strong borders which will keep our country safe. we fight for the borders of other countries but we won’t fight for the borders of our own!senate adjourns until december 27th.brett mcgurk who i do not know was appointed by president obama in 2015. was supposed to leave in february but he just resigned prior to leaving. grandstander? the fake news is making such a big deal about this nothing event!if anybody but your favorite president donald j. trump announced that after decimating isis in syria we were going to bring our troops back home (happy  healthy) that person would be the most popular hero in america. with me hit hard instead by the fake news media. crazy!when president obama ingloriously fired jim mattis i gave him a second chance. some thought i shouldn’t i thought i should. interesting relationship-but i also gave all of the resources that he never really had. allies are very important-but not when they take advantage of u.s.the only way to stop drugs gangs human trafficking criminal elements and much else from coming into our country is with a wall or barrier. drones and all of the rest are wonderful and lots of fun but it is only a good old fashioned wall that works!i am pleased to announce that our very talented deputy secretary of defense patrick shanahan will assume the title of acting secretary of defense starting january 1 2019. patrick has a long list of accomplishments while serving as deputy  previously boeing. he will be great!i just had a long and productive call with president @rt_erdogan of turkey. we discussed isis our mutual involvement in syria  the slow  highly coordinated pullout of u.s. troops from the area. after many years they are coming home. we also discussed heavily expanded trade.unthinkable devastation from the tsunami disaster in indonesia. more than two hundred dead and nearly a thousand injured or unaccounted for. we are praying for recovery and healing. america is with you!we signed two pieces of major legislation this week criminal justice reform and the farm bill. these are two big deals but all the fake news media wants to talk about is “the mistake” of bringing our young people back home from the never ending wars. it all began 19 years ago!senator bob corker just stated that “i’m so priveledged to serve in the senate for twelve years and that’s what i told the people of our state that’s what i’d do serve for two terms.” but that is not true - wanted to run but poll numbers tanked when i wouldn’t endorse him..........bob corker was responsible for giving us the horrible iran nuclear deal which i ended yet he badmouths me for wanting to bring our young people safely back home. bob wanted to run and asked for my endorsement. i said no and the game was over. #maga i love tennessee!“it should not be the job of america to replace regimes around the world. this is what president trump recognized in iraq that it was the biggest foreign policy disaster of the last several decades and he’s right...the generals still don’t get the mistake.”  @randpaulmitch mcconnell just told a group of people and me that he has been in the u.s. senate for 32 years and the last two have been by far the best  most productive of his career. tax  regulation cuts va choice farm bill criminal justice reform judgeships  much more. great!the most important way to stop gangs drugs human trafficking and massive crime is at our southern border. we need border security and as everyone knows you can’t have border security without a wall. the drones  technology are just bells and whistles. safety for america!“the president has been remarkable. i do not doubt that he will thrive in this new environment and he will be a constant reminder of what populism is.” thank you to tammy bruce and steve hilton. presidential harassment has been with me from the beginning!president @rt_erdogan of turkey has very strongly informed me that he will eradicate whatever is left of isis in syria....and he is a man who can do it plus turkey is right “next door.” our troops are coming home!virtually every democrat we are dealing with today strongly supported a border wall or fence. it was only when i made it an important part of my campaign because people and drugs were pouring into our country unchecked that they turned against it. desperately needed!to those few senators who think i don’t like or appreciate being allied with other countries they are wrong i do. what i don’t like however is when many of these same countries take advantage of their friendship with the united states both in military protection and trade.......we are substantially subsidizing the militaries of many very rich countries all over the world while at the same time these countries take total advantage of the u.s. and our taxpayers on trade. general mattis did not see this as a problem. i do and it is being fixed!for all of the sympathizers out there of brett mcgurk remember he was the obama appointee who was responsible for loading up airplanes with 1.8 billion dollars in cash   sending it to iran as part of the horrific iran nuclear deal (now terminated) approved by little bob corker.america is respected again!the only problem our economy has is the fed. they don’t have a feel for the market they don’t understand necessary trade wars or strong dollars or even democrat shutdowns over borders. the fed is like a powerful golfer who can’t score because he has no touch - he can’t putt!i never “lashed out” at the acting attorney general of the u.s. a man for whom i have great respect. this is a made up story one of many by the fake news media!saudi arabia has now agreed to spend the necessary money needed to help rebuild syria instead of the united states. see? isn’t it nice when immensely wealthy countries help rebuild their neighbors rather than a great country the u.s. that is 5000 miles away. thanks to saudi a!i am all alone (poor me) in the white house waiting for the democrats to come back and make a deal on desperately needed border security. at some point the democrats not wanting to make a deal will cost our country more money than the border wall we are all talking about. crazy!i am in the oval office  just gave out a 115 mile long contract for another large section of the wall in texas. we are already building and renovating many miles of wall some complete. democrats must end shutdown and finish funding. billions of dollars  lives will be saved!merry christmas!i hope everyone even the fake news media is having a great christmas! our country is doing very well. we are securing our borders making great new trade deals and bringing our troops back home. we are finally putting america first. merry christmas!  #magajust returned from visiting our troops in iraq and germany. one thing is certain we have incredible people representing our country - people that know how to win!have the democrats finally realized that we desperately need border security and a wall on the southern border. need to stop drugs human traffickinggang members  criminals from coming into our country. do the dems realize that most of the people not getting paid are democrats?the reason the daca for wall deal didn’t get done was that a ridiculous court decision from the 9th circuit allowed daca to remain thereby setting up a supteme court case. after ruling dems dropped deal - and that’s where we are today democrat obstruction of the needed wall.the democrats obstruction of the desperately needed wall where they almost all recently agreed it should be built is exceeded only by their obstruction of 350 great people wanting  expecting to come into government after being delayed for more than two years a u.s. record!the reason the daca for wall deal didn’t get done was that a ridiculous court decision from the 9th circuit allowed daca to remain thereby setting up a supreme court case. after ruling dems dropped deal - and that’s where we are today democrat obstruction of the needed wall.“border patrol agents want the wall.” democrat’s say they don’t want the wall (even though they know it is really needed) and they don’t want ice. they don’t have much to campaign on do they? an open southern border and the large scale crime that comes with such stupidity!there is right now a full scale manhunt going on in california for an illegal immigrant accused of shooting and killing a police officer during a traffic stop. time to get tough on border security. build the wall!brad blakeman: “the american people understand that we have been played by foreign actors who would rather have us fight their battles for them. the pesident says look this is your neighborhood you’ve got to stand up to protect yourselves. don’t always look to america.”brad blakeman: “the american people understand that we have been played by foreign actors who would rather have us fight their battles for them. the president says look this is your neighborhood you’ve got to stand up to protect yourselves. don’t always look to america.”this isn’t about the wall everybody knows that a wall will work perfectly (in israel the wall works 99.9%). this is only about the dems not letting donald trump  the republicans have a win. they may have the 10 senate votes but we have the issue border security. 2020!cnn  others within the fake news universe were going wild about my signing maga hats for our military in iraq and germany. if these brave young people ask me to sign their hat i will sign. can you imagine my saying no? we brought or gave no hats as the fake news first reported!we will be forced to close the southern border entirely if the obstructionist democrats do not give us the money to finish the wall  also change the ridiculous immigration laws that our country is saddled with. hard to believe there was a congress  president who would approve!....the united states looses soooo much money on trade with mexico under nafta over 75 billion dollars a year (not including drug money which would be many times that amount) that i would consider closing the southern border a “profit making operation.” we build a wall or..........close the southern border. bring our car industry back into the united states where it belongs. go back to pre-nafta before so many of our companies and jobs were so foolishly sent to mexico. either we build (finish) the wall or we close the border...........honduras guatemala and el salvador are doing nothing for the united states but taking our money. word is that a new caravan is forming in honduras and they are doing nothing about it. we will be cutting off all aid to these 3 countries - taking advantage of u.s. for years!thank you to sean parnell for the nice comments on @foxandfriends about the troops wonderful reaction to melania and i in iraq and germany. great things are happening!the mueller angry democrats recently deleted approximately 19000 text messages between fbi agent lisa page and her lover agent peter s. these texts were asked for and invaluable to the truth of the witch hunt hoax. this is a total obstruction of justice. all texts demanded!i am in the white house waiting for the democrats to come on over and make a deal on border security. from what i hear they are spending so much time on presidential harassment that they have little time left for things like stopping crime and our military!any deaths of children or others at the border are strictly the fault of the democrats and their pathetic immigration policies that allow people to make the long trek thinking they can enter our country illegally. they can’t. if we had a wall they wouldn’t even try! the two........children in question were very sick before they were given over to border patrol. the father of the young girl said it was not their fault he hadn’t given her water in days. border patrol needs the wall and it will all end. they are working so hard  getting so little credit!for those that naively ask why didn’t the republicans get approval to build the wall over the last year it is because in the senate we need 10 democrat votes and they will gives us “none” for border security! now we have to do it the hard way with a shutdown. too bad! @foxnews“absolutely nothing” (on russian collusion). kimberley strassel the wall street journal. the russian collusion fabrication is the greatest hoax in the history of american politics. the only russian collusion was with hillary and the democrats!“it turns out to be true now that the department of justice and the fbi under president obama rigged the investigation for hillary and really turned the screws on trump and now it looks like in a corrupt  illegal way. the facts are out now. whole hoax exposed. @jessebwattersveterans on president trump’s handling of border security - 62% approval rating. on being a strong leader - 59%.  ap poll. thank you!great work by my administration over the holidays to save coast guard pay during this #schumershutdown. no thanks to the democrats who left town and are not concerned about the safety and security of americans!president and mrs. obama built/has a ten foot wall around their d.c. mansion/compound. i agree totally necessary for their safety and security. the u.s. needs the same thing slightly larger version!an all concrete wall was never abandoned as has been reported by the media. some areas will be all concrete but the experts at border patrol prefer a wall that is see through (thereby making it possible to see what is happening on both sides). makes sense to me!if anybody but donald trump did what i did in syria which was an isis loaded mess when i became president they would be a national hero. isis is mostly gone we’re slowly sending our troops back home to be with their families while at the same time fighting isis remnants.........i campaigned on getting out of syria and other places. now when i start getting out the fake news media or some failed generals who were unable to do the job before i arrived like to complain about me  my tactics which are working. just doing what i said i was going to do!.....except the results are far better than i ever said they were going to be! i campaigned against the never ending wars remember!i campaigned on border security which you cannot have without a strong and powerful wall. our southern border has long been an “open wound” where drugs criminals (including human traffickers) and illegals would pour into our country. dems should get back here an fix now!i am the only person in america who could say that “i’m bringing our great troops back home with victory” and get bad press. it is fake news and pundits who have failed for years that are doing the complaining. if i stayed in endless wars forever they would still be unhappy!i’m in the oval office. democrats come back from vacation now and give us the votes necessary for border security including the wall. you voted yes in 2006 and 3013. one more yes but with me in office i’ll get it built and fast!i’m in the oval office. democrats come back from vacation now and give us the votes necessary for border security including the wall. you voted yes in 2006 and 2013. one more yes but with me in office i’ll get it built and fast!it’s incredible how democrats can all use their ridiculous sound bite and say that a wall doesn’t work. it does and properly built almost 100%! they say it’s old technology - but so is the wheel. they now say it is immoral- but it is far more immoral for people to be dying!heads of countries are calling wanting to know why senator schumer is not approving their otherwise approved ambassadors!? likewise in government lawyers and others are being delayed at a record pace! 360 great and hardworking people are waiting for approval from........senator schumer more than a year longer than any other administration in history. these are people who have been approved by committees and all others yet schumer continues to hold them back from serving their country! very unfair!mexico is paying for the wall through the many billions of dollars a year that the u.s.a. is saving through the new trade deal the usmca that will replace the horrendous nafta trade deal which has so badly hurt our country. mexico  canada will also thrive - good for all!the democrats will probably submit a bill being cute as always which gives everything away but gives nothing to border security namely the wall. you see without the wall there can be no border security - the tech “stuff” is just by comparison meaningless bells  whistles......remember this. throughout the ages some things never get better and never change. you have walls and you have wheels. it was always that way and it will always be that way! please explain to the democrats that there can never be a replacement for a good old fashioned wall!dr. sebastian gorka a very good and talented guy has a great new book just out “why we fight.” lots of insight - enjoy!happy new year to everyone including the haters and the fake news media! 2019 will be a fantastic year for those not suffering from trump derangement syndrome. just calm down and enjoy the ride great things are happening for our country!happy new year!the democrats much as i suspected have allocated no money for a new wall. so imaginative! the problem is without a wall there can be no real border security - and our country must finally have a strong and secure southern border!one thing has now been proven. the democrats do not care about open borders and all of the crime and drugs that open borders bring!congratulations to president @jairbolsonaro who just made a great inauguration speech - the u.s.a. is with you!border security and the wall “thing” and shutdown is not where nancy pelosi wanted to start her tenure as speaker! let’s make a deal?gas prices are low and expected to go down this year. this would be good!washington examiner - “maga list: 205 ‘historic results’ help trump make case for 2020 re-election.”  true!“kim jong un says north korea will not make or test nuclear weapons or give them to others -  he is ready to meet president trump anytime.” pbs news hour. i also look forward to meeting with chairman kim who realizes so well that north korea possesses great economic potential!do you think it’s just luck that gas prices are so low and falling? low gas prices are like another tax cut!for far too long senate democrats have been obstructing more than 350 nominations. these great americans left their jobs to serve our country but can’t because dems are blocking them some for two years-historic record. passed committees but schumer putting them on hold. bad!here we go with mitt romney but so fast! question will be is he a flake?  i hope not. would much prefer that mitt focus on border security and so many other things where he can be helpful. i won big and he didn’t. he should be happy for all republicans. be a team player  win!mexico is paying for the wall through the new usmca trade deal. much of the wall has already been fully renovated or built. we have done a lot of work. $5.6 billion dollars that house has approved is very little in comparison to the benefits of national security. quick payback!important meeting today on border security with republican and democrat leaders in congress. both parties must work together to pass a funding bill that protects this nation and its people – this is the first and most important duty of government......i remain ready and willing to work with democrats to pass a bill that secures our borders supports the agents and officers on the ground and keeps america safe. let’s get it done!sadly there can be no real border security without the wall!the shutdown is only because of the 2020 presidential election. the democrats know they can’t win based on all of the achievements of “trump” so they are going all out on the desperately needed wall and border security - and presidential harassment. for them strictly politics!the united states treasury has taken in many billions of dollars from the tariffs we are charging china and other countries that have not treated us fairly. in the meantime we are doing well in various trade negotiations currently going on. at some point this had to be done!the rnc has a great chairwoman in ronna mcdaniel and the @gop has never been stronger. we achieved historic wins with her help last year! #maga🇺🇸michael pillsbury interviewed by @cvpayne: “they have the motive of making the president look bad – instead of president trump being portrayed as a hero. the first president to take china on it’s 20 years overdue........president trump deserves a lot of credit but again you have the anti-trump people who are not going to give him a lot of credit.”as i have stated many times if the democrats take over the house or senate there will be disruption to the financial markets. we won the senate they won the house. things will settle down. they only want to impeach me because they know they can’t win in 2020 too much success!how do you impeach a president who has won perhaps the greatest election of all time done nothing wrong (no collusion with russia it was the dems that colluded) had the most successful first two years of any president and is the most popular republican in party history 93%?great jobs numbers just announced!the story in the new york times regarding jim webb being considered as the next secretary of defense is fake news. i’m sure he is a fine man but i don’t know jim and never met him. patrick shanahan who is acting secretary of defense is doing a great job!great new book by dr. robert jeffress “choosing the extraordinary life.” get it and enjoy!  @loudobbsgreat support coming from all sides for border security (including wall) on our very dangerous southern border. teams negotiating this weekend! washington post and nbc reporting of events including fake sources has been very inaccurate (to put it mildly)!the democrats could solve the shutdown problem in a very short period of time. all they have to do is approve real border security (including a wall) something which everyone other than drug dealers human traffickers and criminals want very badly! this would be so easy to do!many people currently a part of my opposition including president obama  the dems have had campaign violations in some cases for very large sums of money. these are civil cases. they paid a fine  settled. while no big deal i did not commit a campaign violation!i don’t care that most of the workers not getting paid are democrats i want to stop the shutdown as soon as we are in agreement on strong border security! i am in the white house ready to go where are the dems?we are working hard at the border but we need a wall!  in 2018 1.7 million pounds of narcotics seized 17000 adults arrested with criminal records and 6000 gang members including ms-13 apprehended. a big human trafficking problem.the democrats want billions of dollars for foreign aid but they don’t want to spend a small fraction of that number on properly securing our border. figure that one out!“former @nytimes editor jill abramson rips paper\\'s ‘unmistakably anti-trump’ bias.”ms. abramson is 100% correct. horrible and totally dishonest reporting on almost everything they write. hence the term fake news enemy of the people and opposition party!drug makers and companies are not living up to their commitments on pricing. not being fair to the consumer or to our country!v.p. mike pence and team just left the white house. briefed me on their meeting with the schumer/pelosi representatives. not much headway made today. second meeting set for tomorrow. after so many decades must finally and permanently fix the problems on the southern border!“jobs up big plus 312000. record number working. manufacturing best in 20 years (previous administration said this could not happen). hispanic unemployment lowest ever. dow plus 747 (for day).” @drudge_report“the number of employed americans has now set a 14th record under president trump. over the year average hourly earnings have increased by 84 cents or 3.2%. participation rate hits trump-era high.” cns news.  and we will do even better with new trade deals and all else!ap-norc poll: “immigration among the top concerns in 2019.” people want to stop drugs and criminals at the border. want border security! tell the dems to do the inevitable now rather than later. the wait is costly and dangerous!will be going to camp david tomorrow morning for meetings on border security and many other topics with @whitehouse senior staff.“we simply cannot allow people to pour into the united states undetected undocumented unchecked...” barrack obama 2005. i voted when i was a senator to build a barrier to try to prevent illegal immigrants from coming in...” hillary clinton 2015.....the only reason they do not want to build a wall is that walls work! 99% of our illegal border crossings will end crime in our country will go way down and we will save billions of dollars a year! a properly planned and constructed wall will pay for itself many times a year!excited to see our friends in egypt opening the biggest cathedral in the middle east. president el-sisi is moving his country to a more inclusive future!our great military has delivered justice for the heroes lost and wounded in the cowardly attack on the uss cole. we have just killed the leader of that attack jamal al-badawi. our work against al qaeda continues. we will never stop in our fight against radical islamic terrorism!v.p. mike pence and group had a productive meeting with the schumer/pelosi representatives today. many details of border security were discussed. we are now planning a steel barrier rather than concrete. it is both stronger  less obtrusive. good solution and made in the u.s.a.with all of the success that our country is having including the just released jobs numbers which are off the charts the fake news  totally dishonest media concerning me and my presidency has never been worse. many have become crazed lunatics who have given up on the truth!......the fake news will knowingly lie and demean in order make the tremendous success of the trump administration and me look as bad as possible. they use non-existent sources  write stories that are total fiction. our country is doing so well yet this is a sad day in america!....the fake news media in our country is the real opposition party. it is truly the enemy of the people! we must bring honesty back to journalism and reporting!congressman adam smith the new chairman of the house armed services committee just stated “yes there is a provision in law that says a president can declare an emergency. it’s been done a number of times.” no doubt but let’s get our deal done in

same time continuing to fight isis and doing all else that is prudent and necessary!.....i am pleased to inform you that i will address the nation on the humanitarian and national security crisis on our southern border. tuesday night at 9:00 p.m. eastern.economic numbers looking really good. can you imagine if i had long term zero interest rates to play with like the past administration rather

total waste of time. i asked what is going to happen in 30 days if i quickly open things up are you going to approve border security which includes a wall or steel barrier? nancy said no. i said bye-bye nothing else works!the mainstream media has never been more dishonest than it is now. nbc and msnbc are going crazy. they report stories purposely the exact opposite of the facts. they are truly the opposition party working with the dems. may even be worse than fake news cnn if that is possible!gave an off the record luncheon somewhat of a white house tradition or custom to network anchors yesterday - and they quickly leaked the contents of the meeting. who would believe how bad it has gotten with the mainstream media which has gone totally bonkers!cryin chuck told his favorite lie when he used his standard sound bite that i “slammed the table  walked out of the room. he had a temper tantrum.” because i knew he would say that and after nancy said no to proper border security i politely said bye-bye and left no slamming!there is great unity with the republicans in the house and senate despite the fake news media working in overdrive to make the story look otherwise. the

we have a wall!i often said during rallies with little variation that “mexico will pay for the wall.” we have just signed a great new trade deal with mexico. it is billions of dollars a year better than the very bad nafta deal which it replaces. the difference pays for wall many times over!h1-b holders in the united states can rest assured that changes are soon coming which will bring both

bad and dangerous it is for our entire country.......the steel barrier or wall should have been built by previous administrations long ago. they never got it done - i will. without it our country

york times that the corrupt former leaders of the fbi almost all fired or forced to leave the agency for some very bad reasons opened up an investigation on me for no reason  with no proof after i fired lyin’ james comey a total sleaze!...funny thing about james comey. everybody wanted him fired republican and democrat alike. after the rigged  botched crooked hillary investigation where she was interviewed on july 4th weekend not recorded or sworn in and where she said she didn’t know anything (a lie)........the fbi was in complete turmoil (see n.y. post) because of comey’s poor leadership and the way he handled the clinton mess (not to mention his usurpation of powers from the justice department). my firing of james comey was a great day for america. he was a crooked cop...........who is being totally protected by his best friend bob mueller  the 13 angry democrats - leaking machines who have no interest in going after the real collusion (and much more) by crooked hillary clinton her campaign and the democratic national committee. just watch!i have been far tougher on russia than obama bush or clinton. maybe tougher than any other president. at the same time  as i have often said getting along with russia is a good thing not a bad thing. i fully expect that someday we will have good relations with russia again!lyin’ james comey andrew mccabe peter s and his lover agent

it done! humanitarian crisis.i just watched a fake reporter from the amazon washington post say the white house is “chaotic there does not seem to be a strategy for this shutdown. there is no plan.” the fakes always like talking chaos there is none. in fact there’s almost nobody in the w.h. but me and.......i do have a plan on the shutdown. but to understand that plan you would have to understand the fact that i won the election and i promised safety and security for the american people. part of that promise was a wall at the southern border. elections have consequences!we have a massive humanitarian crisis at our southern border. we will be out for a long time unless the democrats come back from their “vacations” and get back to work. i am in the white house ready to sign!i will be

people await their pay. they are having fun and not even talking!the damage done to our country from a badly broken border - drugs crime and so much that is bad - is far greater than a shutdown which

enemies. we also benefit but it is now time to bring our troops back home. stop the endless wars!so sorry to hear the news about jeff bozo being taken down by a competitor whose reporting i understand

yesterday based on a phony story was impeachment. you want to see a stock market crash impeach trump!many people are saying that the mainstream media will have a very hard time restoring credibility because of the way they have treated me over the past 3 years (including the election lead-up) as highlighted by the disgraceful buzzfeed story  the even more disgraceful coverage!mexico is doing nothing to stop the caravan which is now fully formed and heading to the united states. we stopped the last two - many are still in mexico but can’t get through our wall but it takes a lot of border agents if there is no wall. not easy!i will be live from the white house at 4:00 p.m.always heard that as president “it’s all about the economy!” well we have one of the best economies in the history of our country. big gdp lowest unemployment companies coming back to the u.s. in big numbers great new trade deals happening  more. but little media mention!be careful and try staying in your house. large parts of the country are suffering from  tremendous amounts of snow and near record setting cold. amazing how big this system is. wouldn’t be bad to have a little of that good old fashioned global warming right now!nancy pelosi and some of the democrats turned down my offer yesterday before i even got up to speak. they don’t see crime  drugs they only see 2020 - which they are not going to win. best economy! they should do the right thing for the country  allow people to go back to work.no amnesty is not a part of my offer. it is a 3 year extension of daca. amnesty will be used only on a much bigger deal whether on immigration or something else. likewise there will be no big push to remove the 11000000 plus people who are here illegally-but be careful nancy!nancy pelosi has behaved so irrationally  has gone so far to the left that she has now officially become a radical democrat. she is so petrified of the “lefties” in her party that she has lost control...and by the way clean up the streets in san francisco they are disgusting!nancy i am still thinking about the state of the union speech there are so many options - including doing it as per your written offer (made during the shutdown security is no problem) and my written acceptance. while a contract is a contract i’ll get back to you soon!wow just heard that my poll numbers with hispanics has gone up 19% to 50%. that is because they know the border issue better than anyone and they want security which can only be gotten with a wall.don’t forget we are building and renovating big sections of wall right now. moving quickly and will cost far less than previous politicians thought possible. building after all is what i do best even when money is not readily available!the media is not giving us credit for the tremendous progress we have made with north korea. think of where we were at the end of the obama administration compared to now. great meeting this week with top reps. looking forward to meeting with chairman kim at end of february!to all of the great people who are working so hard for your country and not getting paid i say thank you - you are great patriots! we must now work together after decades of abuse to finally fix the humanitarian criminal  drug crisis at our border. we will win big!congratulations to bob kraft bill belichick tom brady and the entire new england patriots team on a great game and season. will be a fantastic super bowl!curt schilling deserves to be in the baseball hall of fame. great record especially when under pressure and when it mattered most. do what everyone in baseball knows is right! @marklevinshow“no president in modern times has kept more promises than donald trump!” thank you bill bennett @stevehiltonxlast year was the best year for american manufacturing job growth since 1997 or 21 years. the previous administration said manufacturing will not come back to the u.s. “you would need a magic wand.” i guess i found the magic wand - and it is only getting better!democrats campaigned on working within washington and “getting things done!” how is that working out? #2020takebackthehousechina posts slowest economic numbers since 1990 due to u.s. trade tensions and new policies. makes so much sense for china to finally do a real deal and stop playing around!if nancy pelosi thinks that walls are “immoral” why isn’t she requesting that we take down all of the existing walls between the u.s. and mexico even the new ones just built in san diego at their very strong urging. let millions of unchecked “strangers” just flow into the u.s.four people in nevada viciously robbed and killed by an illegal immigrant who should not have been in our country. 26 people killed on the border in a drug and gang related fight. two large caravans from honduras broke into mexico and are headed our way. we need a powerful wall!democrats are kidding themselves (they don’t really believe it!) if they say you can stop crime drugs human trafficking and caravans without a wall or steel barrier. stop playing games and give america the security it deserves. a humanitarian crisis!looking like nick sandman  covington catholic students were treated unfairly with early judgements proving out to be false - smeared by media. not good but making big comeback! “new footage shows that media was wrong about teen’s encounter with native american” @tuckercarlsonnick sandmann and the students of covington have become symbols of fake news and how evil it can be. they have captivated the attention of the world and i know they will use it for the good - maybe even to bring people together. it started off unpleasant but can end in a dream!“the democrats are playing politics with border security.”  @foxandfriendswithout a wall our country can never have border or national security. with a powerful wall or steel barrier crime rates (and drugs) will go substantially down all over the u.s. the dems know this but want to play political games. must finally be done correctly. no cave!fbi top lawyer confirms “unusual steps.” they relied on the clinton campaign’s fake  unverified “dossier” which is illegal. “that has corrupted them. that has enabled them to gather evidence by unconstitutional means and that’s what they did to the president.” judge napolitanomarist/npr/pbs poll shows president trump’s approval rating among latinos going to 50% an increase in one year of 19%. thank you working hard!never seen @senatemajldr and republicans so united on an issue as they are on the humanitarian crisis  security on our southern border. if we create a wall or barrier which prevents criminals and drugs from flowing into our country crime will go down by record numbers!last time i went to davos the fake news said i should not go there. this year because of the shutdown i decided not to go and the fake news said i should be there. the fact is that the people understand the media better than the media understands them!the united states has a great economic story to tell. number one in the world by far!the reason sarah sanders does not go to the “podium” much anymore is that the press covers her so rudely  inaccurately in particular certain members of the press. i told her not to bother the word gets out anyway! most will never cover us fairly  hence the term fake news!former fbi top lawyer james baker just admitted involvement in fisa warrant and further admitted there  were irregularities in the way the russia probe was handled. they relied heavily on the unverified trump “dossier” paid for by the dnc  clinton campaign  funded through a......big crooked hillary law firm represented by her lawyer michael sussmann (do you believe this?) who worked baker hard  gave him oppo research for “a russia probe.” this meeting now exposed is the subject of senate inquiries and much more. an unconstitutional hoax. @foxnewsderoy murdock national review: “we are now exporting oil which is the first time in my lifetime - we are right now the largest producer of oil and gas. this is not good if you’re vladimir putin where your chief export is oil. w.h. agent - not good for kremlin.” @tuckercarlsongreat unity in the republican party. want to once and for all put an end to stoppable crime and drugs! border security and wall. no doubt!build a wall  crime will fall! this is the new theme for two years until the wall is finished (under construction now) of the republican party. use it and pray!build a wall  crime will fall!as the shutdown was going on nancy pelosi asked me to give the state of the union address. i agreed. she then changed her mind because of the shutdown suggesting a later date. this is her prerogative - i will do the address when the shutdown is over. i am not looking for an........alternative venue for the sotu address because there is no venue that can compete with the history tradition and importance of the house chamber. i look forward to giving a “great” state of the union address in the near future!a great new book just out “game of thorns” by doug wead presidential historian and best selling author. the book covers the campaign of 2016 and what could be more exciting than that?“this is everything fdr dreamed about the new deal to put america back to work. think of lbj he gave people food stamps  welfare. donald trump’s giving them a job. he’s got a lot of good things to talk about. news stories do not accurately cover him should correct.” @dougweadthe economy is doing great. more people working in u.s.a. today than at any time in our history. media barely covers! @foxandfriendsso interesting that bad lawyer michael cohen who sadly will not be testifying before congress is using the lawyer of crooked hillary clinton to represent him - gee how did that happen? remember july 4th weekend when crooked went before fbi  wasn’t sworn in no tape nothing?the fake news media loves saying “so little happened at my first summit with kim jong un.” wrong! after 40 years of doing nothing with north korea but being taken to the cleaners  with a major war ready to start in a short 15 months relationships built hostages  remains.......back home where they belong no more rockets or m’s being fired over japan or anywhere else and most importantly no nuclear testing. this is more than has ever been accomplished with north korea and the fake news knows it. i expect another good meeting soon much potential!without a wall there cannot be safety and security at the border or for the u.s.a. build the wall and crime will fall!nancy just said she “just doesn’t understand why?” very simply without a wall it all doesn’t work. our country has a chance to greatly reduce crime human trafficking gangs and drugs. should have been done for decades. we will not cave!great earnings coming out of stock market. too bad media doesn’t devote much time to this!a third rate conman who interviewed me many years ago for just a short period of time has been playing his biggest con of all on fake news cnn. michael d’antonio a broken down hack who knows nothing about me goes on night after night telling made up trump stories. disgraceful!greatest witch hunt in the history of our country! no collusion! border coyotes drug dealers and human traffickers are treated better. who alerted cnn to be there?i wish people would read or listen to my words on the border wall. this was in no way a concession. it was taking care of millions of people who were getting badly hurt by the shutdown with the understanding that in 21 days if no deal is done it’s off to the races!if roger stone was indicted for lying to congress what about the lying done by comey brennan clapper lisa page  lover baker and soooo many others? what about hillary to fbi and her 33000 deleted emails? what about lisa  peter’s deleted texts  wiener’s laptop? much more!“i like the fact that the president is making the case (border security  crime) to the american people. now we know where nancy pelosi chuck schumer  the democrats stand which is no border security. will be big 2020 issue.” matt schlapp chair acu. bigger than anyone knows!21 days goes very quickly. negotiations with democrats will start immediately. will not be easy to make a deal both parties very dug in. the case for national security has been greatly enhanced by what has been happening at the border  through dialogue. we will build the wall!we have turned away at great expense two major caravans but a big one has now formed and is coming. at least 8000 people! if we had a powerful wall they wouldn’t even try to make the long and dangerous journey. build the wall and crime will fall!thank you to the republican national committee (the rnc) who voted unanimously yesterday to support me in the upcoming 2020 election. considering that we have done more than any administration in the first two years this should be easy. more great things now in the works!“we absolutely need a physical barrier or wall whatever you want to call it. the president yesterday laid all that out. we need to do it all including the wall. i provided the same information to the previous administration  it was ignored.” mark morgan border chief for “o”!only fools or people with a political agenda don’t want a wall or steel barrier to protect our country from crime drugs and human trafficking. it will happen - it always does!“ax falls quickly at buzzfeed and huffpost!” headline new york post. fake news and bad journalism have caused a big downturn. sadly many others will follow. the people want the truth!cbs reports that in the roger stone indictment data was “released during the 2016 election to damage hillary clinton.” oh really! what about the fake and unverified “dossier” a total phony conjob that was paid for by crooked hillary to damage me and the trump campaign? what.......about all of the one sided fake media coverage (collusion with crooked h?) that i had to endure during my very successful presidential campaign. what about the now revealed bias by facebook and many others. roger stone didn’t even work for me anywhere near the election!witch hunt!58000 non-citizens voted in texas with 95000 non-citizens registered to vote. these numbers are just the tip of the iceberg. all over the country especially in california voter fraud is rampant. must be stopped. strong voter id! @foxandfriendswe are not even into february and the cost of illegal immigration so far this year is $18959495168. cost friday was $603331392. there are at least 25772342 illegal aliens not the 11000000 that have been reported for years in our country. so ridiculous! dhsjens stoltenberg nato secretary general just stated that because of me nato has been able to raise far more money than ever before from its members after many years of decline. it’s called burden sharing. also more united. dems  fake news like to portray the opposite!never thought i’d say this but i think @johnrobertsfox and @jillianturner @foxnews have even less understanding of the wall negotiations than the folks at fake news cnn  nbc! look to final results! don’t know how my poll numbers are so good especially up 19% with hispanics?never thought i’d say this but i think @johnrobertsfox and @gillianhturner @foxnews have even less understanding of the wall negotiations than the folks at fake news cnn  nbc! look to final results! don’t know how my poll numbers are so good especially up 19% with hispanics?after all that i have done for the military our great veterans judges (99) justices (2) tax  regulation cuts the economy energy trade  much more does anybody really think i won’t build the wall? done more in first two years than any president! make america great again!tariffs on the “dumping” of steel in the united states have totally revived our steel industry. new and expanded plants are happening all over the u.s. we have not only saved this important industry but created many jobs. also billions paid to our treasury. a big win for u.s.numerous states introducing bible literacy classes giving students the option of studying the bible. starting to make a turn back? great!howard schultz doesn’t have the “guts” to run for president! watched him on @60minutes last night and i agree with him that he is not the “smartest person.” besides america already has that! i only hope that starbucks is still paying me their rent in trump tower!“in the media’s effort to destroy the president they are actually destroying themselves. given all of the tremendous headwinds this president has faced it’s amazing he has accomplished so much.” deroy murdock @foxandfriends  i agree!in the beautiful midwest windchill temperatures are reaching minus 60 degrees the coldest ever recorded. in coming days expected to get even colder. people can’t last outside even for minutes. what the hell is going on with global waming? please come back fast we need you!how does da nang dick (blumenthal) serve on the senate judiciary committee when he defrauded the american people about his so called war hero status in vietnam only to later admit with tears pouring down his face that he was never in vietnam. an embarrassment to our country!a low level staffer that i hardly knew named cliff sims wrote yet another boring book based on made up stories and fiction. he pretended to be an insider when in fact he was nothing more than a gofer. he signed a non-disclosure agreement. he is a mess!“our economy right now is the gold standard throughout the world.” @ingrahamangle  so true and not even close!maduro willing to negotiate with opposition in venezuela following u.s. sanctions and the cutting off of oil revenues. guaido is being targeted by venezuelan supreme court. massive protest expected today. americans should not travel to venezuela until further notice.when i became president isis was out of control in syria  running rampant. since then tremendous progress made especially over last 5 weeks. caliphate will soon be destroyed unthinkable two years ago. negotiating are proceeding well in afghanistan after 18 years of fighting......fighting continues but the people of afghanistan want peace in this never ending war. we will soon see if talks will be successful? north korea relationship is best it has ever been with u.s. no testing getting remains hostages returned. decent chance of denuclearization......time will tell what will happen with north korea but at the end of the previous administration relationship was horrendous and very bad things were about to happen. now a whole different story. i look forward to seeing kim jong un shortly. progress being made-big difference!if the committee of republicans and democrats now meeting on border security is not discussing or contemplating a wall or physical barrier they are wasting their time!“three separate caravans marching to our border. the numbers are tremendous.” @foxandfriendsthe intelligence people seem to be extremely passive and naive when it comes to the dangers of iran. they are wrong! when i became president iran was making trouble all over the middle east and beyond. since ending the terrible iran nuclear deal they are much different but........a source of potential danger and conflict. they are testing rockets (last week) and more and are coming very close to the edge. there economy is now crashing which is the only thing holding them back. be careful of iran. perhaps intelligence should go back to school!dow just broke 25000. tremendous news!spoke today with venezuelan interim president juan guaido to congratulate him on his historic assumption of the presidency and reinforced strong united states support for venezuela’s fight to regain its democracy........large protests all across venezuela today against maduro. the fight for freedom has begun!so great to watch  listen to all these people who write books  talk about my presidential campaign and so many others things related to winning and how i should be doing “it.” as i take it all in i then sit back look around  say “gee i’m in the white house  they’re not!large sections of wall have already been built with much more either under construction or ready to go. renovation of existing walls is also a very big part of the plan to finally after many decades properly secure our border. the wall is getting done one way or the other!lets just call them walls from now on and stop playing political games! a wall is a wall!very sadly murder cases in mexico in 2018 rose 33% from 2017 to 33341. this is a big contributor to the humanitarian crises taking place on our southern border and then spreading throughout our country. worse even than afghanistan. much caused by drugs. wall is being built!with murders up 33% in mexico a record why wouldn’t any sane person want to build a wall! construction has started and will not stop until it is finished. @loudobbs @foxandfriendschina’s top trade negotiators are in the u.s. meeting with our representatives. meetings are going well with good intent and spirit on both sides. china does not want an increase in tariffs and feels they will do much better if they make a deal. they are correct. i will be..........meeting with their top leaders and representatives today in the oval office. no final deal will be made until my friend president xi and i meet in the near future to discuss and agree on some of the long standing and more difficult points. very comprehensive transaction........china’s representatives and i are trying to do a complete deal leaving nothing unresolved on the table. all of the many problems are being discussed and will be hopefully resolved. tariffs on china increase to 25% on march 1st so all working hard to complete by that date!republicans on the homeland security committee are wasting their time. democrats despite all of the evidence proof and caravans coming are not going to give money to build the desperately needed wall. i’ve got you covered. wall is already being built i don’t expect much help!democrats are becoming the party of late term abortion high taxes open borders and crime!more troops being sent to the southern border to stop the attempted invasion of illegals through large caravans into our country. we have stopped the previous caravans and we will stop these also. with a wall it would be soooo much easier and less expensive. being built!looking for china to open their markets not only to financial services which they are now doing but also to our manufacturing farmers and other u.s. businesses and industries. without this a deal would be unacceptable!schumer and the democrats are big fans of being weak and passive with iran. they have no clue as to the danger they would be inflicting on our country. iran is in financial chaos now because of the sanctions and iran deal termination. dems put us in a bad place - but now good!very sadly murder cases in mexico in 2018 rose 33% from 2017 to 33341. this is a big contributor to the humanitarian crisis taking place on our southern border and then spreading throughout our country. worse even than afghanistan. much caused by drugs. wall is being built!....i would suggest you read the complete testimony from tuesday. a false narrative is so bad for our country. i value our intelligence community. happily we had a very good meeting and we are all on the same page!our great u.s. border patrol agents made the biggest fentanyl bust in our country’s history. thanks as always for a job well done!just out: the big deal very mysterious don jr telephone calls after the innocent trump tower meeting that the media  dems said were made to his father (me) were just conclusively found not to be made to me. they were made to friends  business associates of don. really sad!nellie ohr the wife of doj official bruce ohr was long ago investigating for pay (gps fusion) members of my family feeding it to her husband who was then giving it to the fbi even though it was created by ousted  discredited christopher steele. illegal! witch hunti inherited a total mess in syria and afghanistan the “endless wars” of unlimited spending and death. during my campaign i said very strongly that these wars must finally end. we spend $50 billion a year in afghanistan and have hit them so hard that we are now talking peace.......after 18 long years. syria was loaded with isis until i came along. we will soon have destroyed 100% of the caliphate but will be watching them closely. it is now time to start coming home and after many years spending our money wisely. certain people must get smart!best january for the dow in over 30 years. we have by far the strongest economy in the world!thank you to senator rob portman and senator cory gardner for the early and warm endorsement. we will all win in 2020 together!democrat governor ralph northam of virginia just stated “i believe that i am not either of the people in that photo.” this was 24 hours after apologizing for appearing in the picture and after making the most horrible statement on “super” late term abortion. unforgivable!ed gillespie who ran for governor of the great state of virginia against ralph northam must now be thinking malpractice and dereliction of duty with regard to his opposition research staff. if they find that terrible picture before the election he wins by 20 points!i will be interviewed sunday morning on @facethenation and prior to the super bowl on @cbs at 3:30 p.m. enjoy!everyone is asking how tiger played yesterday. the answer is great! he was long straight  putted fantastically well. he shot a 64. tiger is back  will be winning majors again! not surprisingly jack also played really well. his putting is amazing! jack  tiger like each other.with caravans marching through mexico and toward our country republicans must be prepared to do whatever is necessary for strong border security. dems do nothing. if there is no wall there is no security. human trafficking drugs and criminals of all dimensionns - keep out!with caravans marching through mexico and toward our country republicans must be prepared to do whatever is necessary for strong border security. dems do nothing. if there is no wall there is no security. human trafficking drugs and criminals of all dimensions - keep out!i am pleased to announce that david bernhardt acting secretary of the interior will be nominated as secretary of the interior. david has done a fantastic job from the day he arrived and we look forward to having his nomination officially confirmed!tremendous numbers of people are coming up through mexico in the hopes of flooding our southern border. we have sent additional military. we will build a human wall if necessary. if we had a real wall this would be a non-event!i see schumer is already criticizing my state of the union speech even though he hasn’t seen it yet. he’s just upset that he didn’t win the senate after spending a fortune like he thought he would. too bad we weren’t given more credit for the senate win by the media!so now congressman adam schiff announces after having found zero russian collusion that he is going to be looking at every aspect of my life both financial and personal even though there is no reason to be doing so. never happened before! unlimited presidential harassment........the dems and their committees are going “nuts.” the republicans never did this to president obama there would be no time left to run government. i hear other committee heads will do the same thing. even stealing people who work at white house! a continuation of witch hunt!democrats at the top are killing the great state of virginia. if the three failing pols were republicans far stronger action would be taken. virginia will come back home republican) in 2020!presidential harassment! it should never be allowed to happen again!so nice how well my state of the union speech was received. thank you to all!highly respected senator richard burr chairman of senate intelligence said today that after an almost two year investigation he saw no evidence of russia collusion. “we don’t have anything that would suggest there was collusion by the trump campaign and russia.”  thank you!not only did senator burr’s committee find no collusion by the trump campaign and russia it’s important because they interviewed 200 witnesses and 300000 pages of documents  the committee has direct access to intelligence information that’s classified. @greggjarrettnow we find out that adam schiff was spending time together in aspen with glenn simpson of gps fusion who wrote the fake and discredited dossier even though simpson was testifying before schiff. john solomon of @thehillthe mainstream media has refused to cover the fact that the head of the very important senate intelligence committee after two years of intensive study and access to intelligence that only they could get just stated that they have found no collusion between “trump”  russia.......it is all a giant and illegal hoax developed long before the election itself but used as an excuse by the democrats as to why crooked hillary clinton lost the election! someday the fake news media will turn honest  report that donald j. trump was actually a great candidate!deepest sympathies to congresswoman debbie dingell and the entire family of john dingell. longest serving congressman in country’s history which if people understand politics means he was very smart. a great reputation and highly respected man.i was a big fan of frank robinson both as a great player and man. he was the first african american manager in baseball and was highly respected at everything he did. he will he missed!my representatives have just left north korea after a very productive meeting and an agreed upon time and date for the second summit with kim jong un. it will take place in hanoi vietnam on february 27  28. i look forward to seeing chairman kim  advancing the cause of peace!north korea under the leadership of kim jong un will become a great economic powerhouse. he may surprise some but he won’t surprise me because i have gotten to know him  fully understand how capable he is. north korea will become a different kind of rocket - an economic one!it was great meeting some of our outstanding young military personnel who were wounded in both syria and afghanistan. their wounds are deep but their spirit is sooo high. they will recoverer  be back very soon. america loves them. walter reed hospital is amazing - thank you all!the democrats in congress yesterday were vicious and totally showed their cards for everyone to see. when the republicans had the majority they never acted with such hatred and scorn! the dems are trying to win an election in 2020 that they know they cannot legitimately win!we have a great economy despite the obama administration and all of its job killing regulations and roadblocks. if that thinking prevailed in the 2016 election the u.s. would be in a depression right now! we were heading down and don’t let the democrats sound bites fool you!the democrats just don’t seem to want border security. they are fighting border agents recommendations. if you believe news reports they are not offering much for the wall. they look to be making this a campaign issue. the wall will get built one way or the other!today elizabeth warren sometimes referred to by me as pocahontas joined the race for president. will she run as our first native american presidential candidate or has she decided that after 32 years this is not playing so well anymore? see you on the campaign trail liz!i think it is very important for the democrats to press forward with their green new deal. it would be great for the so-called “carbon footprint” to permanently eliminate all planes cars cows oil gas  the military - even if no other country would do the same. brilliant!senator richard burr the chairman of the senate intelligence committee just announced that after almost two years more than two hundred interviews and thousands of documents they have found no collusion between trump and russia! is anybody really surprised by this?african americans are very angry at the double standard on full display in virginia!gallup poll: “open borders will potentially attract 42 million latin americans.” this would be a disaster for the u.s. we need the wall now!i don’t think the dems on the border committee are being allowed by their leaders to make a deal. they are offering very little money for the desperately needed border wall  now out of the blue want a cap on convicted violent felons to be held in detention!it was a very bad week for the democrats with the great economic numbers the virginia disaster and the state of the union address. now with the terrible offers being made by them to the border committee i actually believe they want a shutdown. they want a new subject!the media was able to get my work schedule something very easy to do but it should have been reported as a positive not negative. when the term executive time is used i am generally working not relaxing. in fact i probably work more hours than almost any past president.........the fact is when i took over as president our country was a mess. depleted military endless wars a potential war with north korea v.a. high taxes  too many regulations border immigration  healthcare problems  much more. i had no choice but to work very long hours!“president is on sound legal ground to declare a national emergency. there have been 58 national emergencies declared since the law was enacted in 1976 and 31 right now that are currently active so this is hardly unprecedented.” congressman @tommcclintockthe border committee democrats are behaving all of a sudden irrationally. not only are they unwilling to give dollars for the obviously needed wall (they overrode recommendations of border patrol experts) but they don’t even want to take muderers into custody! what’s going on?well it happened again. amy klobuchar announced that she is running for president talking proudly of fighting global warming while standing in a virtual blizzard of snow ice and freezing temperatures. bad timing. by the end of her speech she looked like a snowman(woman)!“fact checkers have become fake news.” @jessebwatters   so true!no president ever worked harder than me (cleaning up the mess i inherited)!the democrats do not want us to detain or send back criminal aliens! this is a brand new demand. crazy!the democrats are so self righteous and angry! loosen up and have some fun. the country is doing well!will be heading to el paso very soon. big speech on border security and much else tonight. tremendous crowd! see you later!coal is an important part of our electricity generation mix and @tvanews should give serious consideration to all factors before voting to close viable power plants like paradise #3 in kentucky!was just presented the concept and parameters of the border security deal by hard working senator richard shelby. looking over all aspects knowing that this will be hooked up with lots of money from other sources........will be getting almost $23 billion for border security. regardless of wall money it is being built as we speak!i want to thank all republicans for the work you have done in dealing with the radical left on border security. not an easy task but the wall is being built and will be a great achievement and contributor toward life and safety within our country!the senate intelligence committee: there is no evidence of collusion between the trump campaign and russia!the gallup poll just announced that 69% of our great citizens expect their finances to improve next year a 16 year high. nice!california has been forced to cancel the massive bullet train project after having spent and wasted many billions of dollars. they owe the federal government three and a half billion dollars. we want that money back now. whole project is a “green” disaster!disgraced fbi acting director andrew mccabe pretends to be a “poor little angel” when in fact he was a big part of the crooked hillary scandal  the russia hoax - a puppet for leakin’ james comey. i.g. report on mccabe was devastating. part of “insurance policy” in case i won........many of the top fbi brass were fired forced to leave or left. mccabe’s wife received big dollars from clinton people for her

abortion is now so extreme that they don’t mind executing babies after birth........this will be remembered as one of the most shocking votes in the history of congress. if there is one thing we should all agree on it’s protecting the lives of innocent babies.vietnam is thriving like few places on earth. north korea would be the same and very quickly if it would denuclearize. the potential is awesome a great opportunity like almost none other in history for my friend kim jong un. we will know fairly soon - very interesting!the democrats should stop talking about what i should do with north korea and ask themselves instead why they didn’t do “it” during eight years of the obama administration?i have now spent more time in vietnam than da nang dick blumenthal the third rate senator from connecticut (how is connecticut doing?). his war stories of his heroism in vietnam were a total fraud - he was never even there. we talked about it today with vietnamese leaders!michael cohen was one of many lawyers who represented me (unfortunately). he had other clients also. he was just disbarred by the state supreme court for lying  fraud. he did bad things unrelated to trump. he is lying in

tonight in vietnam with kim jong un of north korea. very good dialogue. resuming tomorrow!everyone must watch the opening to @tuckercarlson - a classic! @foxnewsgreat to be back from vietnam an amazing place. we had very substantive negotiations with kim jong un - we know what they want and they know what we must have. relationship very good let’s see what happens!wow just revealed that michael cohen wrote a “love letter to trump” manuscript for a new book that he was pushing. written and submitted long after charlottesville and helsinki his phony reasons for going rogue. book is exact opposite of his fake testimony which now is a lie!congress must demand the transcript of michael cohen’s new book given to publishers a short time ago. your heads will spin when you see the lies misrepresentations and contradictions  against his thursday testimony. like a different person! he is totally discredited!oh’ i see! now that the 2 year russian collusion case has fallen apart there was no collusion except bye crooked hillary and the democrats they say “gee i have an idea let’s look at trump’s finances and every deal he has ever done. let’s follow discredited michael cohen........and the fraudulent and dishonest statements he made on wednesday. no way it’s time to stop this corrupt and illegally brought witch hunt. time to start looking at the other side where real crimes were committed. republicans have been abused long enough. must end now!michael cohen’s book manuscript shows that he committed perjury on a scale not seen before. he must have forgotten about his book when he testified. what does hillary clinton’s lawyer lanny davis say about this one. is he being paid by crooked hillary. using her lawyer?i never like being misinterpreted but especially when it comes to otto warmbier and his great family. remember i got otto out along with three others. the previous administration did nothing and he was taken on their watch. of course i hold north korea responsible........for otto’s mistreatment and death. most important otto warmbier will not have died in vain. otto and his family have become a tremendous symbol of strong passion and strength which will last for many years into the future. i love otto and think of him often!i have asked china to immediately remove all tariffs on our agricultural products (including beef pork

rather than his lies for sentence reduction!the brand new manuscript for a new book by failed lawyer michael cohen shows his testimony was a total lie! pundits should only use it.we’ve got nasa “rocking” again. great activity and success. congrats to spacex and all!...said was a total lie but fake media won’t show it. i am an innocent man being persecuted by some very bad conflicted  corrupt people in a witch hunt that is illegal  should never have been allowed to start - and only because i won the election! despite this great success!after more than two years of presidential harassment the only things that have been proven is that democrats and other broke the law. the hostile cohen testimony given by a liar to reduce his prison time proved no collusion! his just written book manuscript showed what he.....“look how they’re acting now and how we act when we’re in the majority. what the democrats are doing is an abuse of power. they couldn’t find anything...they took a fake

military drills with south korea is to save hundreds of millions of dollars for the u.s. for which we are not reimbursed. that was my position long before i became president. also reducing tensions with north korea at this time is a good thing!presidential harassment by “crazed” democrats at the highest level in the history of our country. likewise the most vicious and corrupt mainstream media that any president has ever had to endure - yet the most successful first two years for any....president. we are winning big the envy of the world but just think what it could be?for the democrats to interview in open hearings a convicted liar  fraudster at the same time as the very important nuclear summit with north korea is perhaps a new low in american politics and may have contributed to the “walk.” never done when a president is overseas. shame!to the great people of alabama and surrounding areas: please be careful and safe. tornadoes and storms were truly violent and more could be coming. to the families and friends of the victims and to the injured god bless you all!fema has been told directly by me to give the a plus treatment to the great state of alabama and the wonderful

working closely with fema (and me!).the military drills or war games as i call them were never even discussed in my mtg w/ kim jong un of nk—fake news! i made that decision long ago because it costs the u.s. far too much money to have those “games” especially since we are not reimbursed for the tremendous cost!“now that the dems are going to try  switch from collusion to some other reason it makes them continue to look like sore losers who didn’t accept the will of the people in the last election - they will do anything to get rid of the president.” @arifleischer it will never work!“there is no collusion. all of these investigations are in search of a crime. democrats have no evidence to impeach president trump. ridiculous!” @devinnunes @foxnews“the american media has changed forever. news organizations that seemed like a big deal are now extinct.  those that remain have now degraded themselves beyond recognition like the new yorker - or they’ve been purchased by jeff bezos to

what this vote is all about. stay united!it is shameful that house democrats won’t take a stronger stand against anti-semitism in their conference. anti-semitism has fueled atrocities throughout history and it’s inconceivable they will not act to condemn it!congressman chris stewart: “no one is accusing the president of a crime and yet they (the democrats) are issuing hundreds of subpoenas.

were no violations of the campaign finance laws by me. fake news!we are on track to apprehend more than one million people coming across the southern border this year. great job by border patrol (and

radicals against me (not to mention certain republicans who are sadly unwilling to fight) i am winning on the border. major sections of wall are being built.......and renovated with much more to follow shortly. tens of thousands of illegals are being apprehended (captured) at the border and not allowed into our country. with another president millions would be pouring in. i am stopping an

statement against impeachment but everyone must remember the minor fact that i never did anything wrong the economy and unemployment are the best ever military and vets are great - and many other successes! how do you impeach........a man who is considered by many to be the president with the most successful first two years in history especially when he has done nothing wrong and impeachment is for “high crimes and misdemeanors”?“jay leno points out that comedy (on the very boring late night shows) is totally one-sided. it’s tough when there’s only one topic.” @foxandfriends  actually the one-sided hatred on these shows is incredible and for me unwatchable. but remember we are number one - president!make america great again!keep america great!the just revealed fbi agent lisa page

major national emergency at our border and the people of our country know it very well!“the lisa page (fbi) transcript also confirms earlier reporting that page testified russian collusion was still unproven when special counsel robert mueller was appointed.” catherine herridge @foxnews  in other words they appointed someone when there was (and is) no crime. bad!a big national emergency vote today by the united states senate on border security  the wall (which is already under major construction). i am prepared to veto if necessary. the southern border is a national security and humanitarian nightmare but it can be easily fixed!my administration looks forward to negotiating a large scale trade deal with the united kingdom. the potential is unlimited!the democrats are “border deniers.” they refuse to see or acknowledge the death crime drugs and human trafficking at our southern border!the three very weak and untalented late night “hosts” are “fighting over table scraps.

@foxandfriendsprominent legal scholars agree that our actions to address the national emergency at the southern border and to protect the american people are both constitutional and expressly authorized by congress........if at a later date congress wants to update the law i will support those efforts but today’s issue is border security and crime!!! don’t vote with pelosi!a vote for today’s resolution by republican senators is a vote for nancy pelosi crime and the open border democrats!veto!i look forward to vetoing the just passed democrat inspired resolution which would open borders while increasing crime drugs and trafficking in our country. i thank all of the strong republicans who voted to support border security and our desperately needed wall!my warmest sympathy and best wishes goes out to the people of new zealand after the horrible massacre in the mosques. 49 innocent people have so senselessly died with so many more seriously injured. the u.s. stands by new zealand for anything we can do. god bless all!the ‘jexodus’ movement encourages jewish people to leave the democrat party. total disrespect! republicans are waiting with open arms. remember jerusalem (u.s. embassy) and the horrible iran nuclear deal! @oann  @foxandfriends“new evidence that the obama era team of the fbi doj  cia were working together to spy on (and take out) president trump all the way back in 2015.” a transcript of peter strzok’s testimony is devastating. hopefully the mueller report will be covering this. @oann @foxandfriendsso if there was knowingly  acknowledged to be “zero” crime when the special counsel was appointed and if the appointment was made based on the fake dossier (paid for by crooked hillary) and now disgraced andrew mccabe (he  all stated no crime) then the special counsel...........should never have been appointed and there should be no mueller report. this was an illegal  conflicted investigation in search of a crime. russian collusion was nothing more than an excuse by the democrats for losing an election that they thought they were going to win..........this should never happen to a president again!i’d like to thank all of the great republican senators who bravely voted for strong border security and the wall. this will help stop crime human trafficking and drugs entering our country. watch when you get back to your state they will love you more than ever before!just spoke with jacinda ardern the prime minister of new zealand regarding the horrific events that have taken place over the past 24 hours. i informed the prime minister........that we stand in solidarity with new zealand – and that any assistance the u.s.a. can give we stand by ready to help. we love you new zealand!just spoke w/ @govricketts. the people of nebraska  across the midwest especially the farmers  ranchers are feeling the impacts from severe weather. the first responders  emergency response teams have done a great job dealing w/ record flooding high winds  road closures.on the recent non-binding vote (420-0) in congress about releasing the mueller report i told leadership to let all republicans vote for transparency. makes us all look good and doesn’t matter. play along with the game!mark morgan former border patrol chief with great experience in law enforcement really understands the subjects of immigration and the border. thank you mark!  @foxandfriendsspreading the fake and totally discredited dossier “is unfortunately a very dark stain against john mccain.” ken starr former independent counsel. he had far worse “stains” than this including thumbs down on repeal and replace after years of campaigning to repeal and replace!because the economy is so good general motors must get their lordstown ohio plant open maybe in a different form or with a new owner fast! toyota is investing 13.5 $billion in u.s. others likewise. g.m. must act quickly. time is of the essence!google is helping china and their military but not the u.s. terrible! the good news is that they helped crooked hillary clinton and not trump....and how did that turn out?it’s truly incredible that shows like saturday night live not funny/no talent can spend all of their time knocking the same person (me) over  over without so much of a mention of “the other side.” like an advertisement without consequences. same with late night shows..........should federal election commission and/or fcc look into this? there must be collusion with the democrats and of course russia! such one sided media coverage most of it fake news. hard to believe i won and am winning. approval rating 52% 93% with republicans. sorry!  #magareport: christopher steele backed up his democrat  crooked hillary paid for fake  unverified dossier with information he got from “send in watchers” of low ratings cnn. this is the info that got us the witch hunt!so it was indeed (just proven in court papers) “last in his class” (annapolis) john mccain that sent the fake dossier to the fbi and media hoping to have it printed before the election. he  the dems working together  failed (as usual). even the fake news refused this garbage!so it was indeed (just proven in court papers) “last in his class” (annapolis) john mccain that sent the fake dossier to the fbi and media hoping to have it printed before the election. he  the dems working together failed (as usual). even the fake news refused this garbage!bring back @judgejeanine pirro. the radical left democrats working closely with their beloved partner the fake news media is using every trick in the book to silence a majority of our country. they have all out campaigns against @foxnews hosts who are doing too well. fox .........must stay strong and fight back with vigor. stop working soooo hard on being politically correct which will only bring you down and continue to fight for our country. the losers all want what you have don’t give it to them. be strong  prosper be weak  die! stay true........to the people that got you there. keep fighting for tucker and fight hard for @judgejeanine. your competitors are jealous - they all want what you’ve got - number one. don’t hand it to them on a silver platter. they can’t beat you you can only beat yourselves!democrat uaw local 1112 president david green ought to get his act together and produce. g.m. let our

anchors @arthelneville and @lelandvittert trained by cnn prior to their ratings collapse? in any event that’s where they should be working along with their lowest rated anchor shepard smith!those republican senators who voted in favor of strong border security (and the wall) are being uniformly praised as they return to their states. they know there is a national emergency at the southern border and they had the courage to act. great job!just spoke to mary barra ceo of general motors about the lordstown ohio plant. i am not happy that it is closed when everything else in our country is booming. i asked her to sell it or do something quickly. she blamed the uaw union — i don’t care i just want it open!what the democrats have done in trying to steal a presidential election first at the “ballot box” and then after that failed with the “insurance policy” is the biggest scandal in the history of our country!make america great again!general motors and the uaw are going to start “talks” in september/october. why wait start them now! i want jobs to stay in the u.s.a. and want lordstown (ohio) in one of the best economies in our history opened or sold to a company who will open it up fast! car companies.........are all coming back to the u.s. so is everyone else. we now have the best economy in the world the envy of all. get that big beautiful plant in ohio open now. close a plant in china or mexico where you invested so heavily pre-trump but not in the u.s.a. bring jobs home!93% approval rating in the republican party. thank you!joe biden got tongue tied over the weekend when he was unable to properly deliver a very simple line about his decision to run for president. get used to it another low i.q. individual!the fake news media is working overtime to blame me for the horrible attack in new zealand. they will have to work very hard to prove that one. so ridiculous!wow! a suffolk/usa today poll just out states “50% of americans agree that  robert mueller’s investigation is a witch hunt.” @msnbc  very few think it is legit! we will soon find out?gdp growth during the four quarters of 2018 was the fastest since 2005. this administration is the first on record to have experienced economic growth that meets or exceeds its own forecasts in each of its first two years in office. growth is beating market expectations!the fake news media has never been more dishonest or corrupt than it is right now. there has never been a time like this in american history. very exciting but also very sad! fake news is the absolute enemy of the people and our country itself!“you can’t dispel this mood of positive energy.”  @varneyco  the economy is great!amazingly cnn just released a poll at 71% saying that the economy is in the best shape since 2001 18 years! wow is cnn becoming a believer?....just the large states - the cities would end up running the country. smaller states  the entire midwest would end up losing all power -  we can’t let that happen. i used to like the idea of the popular vote but now realize the electoral college is far better for the u.s.a.the democrats are getting very “strange.” they now want to change the voting age to 16 abolish the electoral college and increase significantly the number of supreme court justices. actually you’ve got to win it at the ballot box!george conway often referred to as mr. kellyanne conway by those who know him is very jealous of his wife’s success  angry that i with her help didn’t give him the job he so desperately wanted. i barely know him but just take a look a stone cold loser  husband from hell!great news from @ford! they are investing nearly $1 billion in flat rock michigan for auto production on top of a $1 billion investment last month in a facility outside of chicago. companies are pouring back into the united states - they want to be where the action is!“the reason we have the special counsel investigation is that james comey (a dirty cop) leaked his memos to a friend who leaked them to the press on purpose.” @kennedynation totally illegal!after 52 years it is time for the united states to fully recognize israel’s sovereignty over the golan heights which is of critical strategic and security importance to the state of israel and regional stability!3.1 gdp for the year best number in 14 years!“our own benjamin hall is doing fantastic

pete hegseth @foxandfriendsisis uses the internet better than almost anyone but for all of those susceptible to isis propaganda they are now being beaten badly at every level........there is nothing to admire about them they will always try to show a glimmer of vicious hope but they are losers and barely breathing. think about that before you destroy your lives and the lives of your family!it is my pleasure to announce that @stephenmoore a very respected economist will be nominated to serve on the fed board. i have known steve for a long time – and have no doubt he will be an outstanding choice!it was announced today by the u.s. treasury that additional large scale sanctions would be added to those already existing sanctions on north korea. i have today ordered the withdrawal of those additional sanctions!good morning have a great day!make america great again!no collusion no obstruction complete and total exoneration. keep america great!“no matter your ideologies or your loyalties this is a good day for america. no american conspired to cooperate with russia in its efforts to interfere with the 2016 election according to robert mueller and that is good.”  @bretbaier  @foxnews“the special counsel did not find that the trump campaign or anyone associated with it conspired or coordinated with the russian government in these efforts despite multiple offers from russian-affiliated individuals to assist the trump campaign.”“breaking news: mueller report finds no trump-russia conspiracy.” @msnbcthe mainstream media is under fire and being scorned all over the world as being corrupt and fake. for two years they pushed the russian collusion delusion when they always knew there was no collusion. they truly are the enemy of the people and the real opposition party!“what we’re seeing on capital hill right now is that the democrats are walking back any charges of collusion against the president.” @byronyork  @billhemmer should never have been started a disgrace!“what we’re seeing on capitol hill right now is that the democrats are walking back any charges of collusion against the president.” @byronyork @billhemmer should never have been started a disgrace!the republican party will become “the party of healthcare!”thank you to the house republicans for sticking together and the big win today on the border. today’s vote simply reaffirms congressional democrats are the party of open borders drugs and crime!“i think this is probably the most consequential media screwup of the last 25 to 50 years. it is difficult to comprehend or overstate the damage that the media did to the country to their own reputation or to the constitution. an absolute catastrophe” sean davis  @tuckercarlsonthe fake news media has lost tremendous credibility with its corrupt coverage of the illegal democrat witch hunt of your all time favorite duly elected president me! t.v. ratings of cnn  msnbc tanked last night after seeing the mueller report statement. @foxnews up big!just met with @sundarpichai president of @google who is obviously doing quite well. he stated strongly that he is totally committed to the u.s. military not the chinese military........also discussed political fairness and various things that @google can do for our country. meeting ended very well!will be heading to grand rapids michigan tonight for a big rally. will be talking about the many exciting things that are happening to our country but also the car companies  others that are pouring back into michigan ohio pennsylvania north  south carolina  all over!the fake news media is going crazy! they are suffering a major “breakdown” have zero credibility or respect  must be thinking about going legit. i have learned to live with fake news which has never been more corrupt than it is right now. someday i will tell you the secret!mexico is doing nothing to help stop the flow of illegal immigrants to our country. they are all talk and no action. likewise honduras guatemala and el salvador have taken our money for years and do nothing. the dems don’t care such bad laws. may close the southern border!fbi  doj to review the outrageous jussie smollett case in chicago. it is an embarrassment to our nation!wow ratings for “morning joe” which were really bad in the first place just “tanked” with the release of the mueller report. likewise other shows on msnbc and cnn have gone down by as much as 50%. just shows fake news never wins!very important that opec increase the flow of oil. world markets are fragile price of oil getting too high. thank you!the republican party will become the party of great healthcare! obamacare is a disaster far too expensive and deductibility ridiculously high - virtually unusable! moving forward in courts and legislatively!we have a national emergency at our southern border. the dems refuse to do what they know is necessary - amend our immigration laws. would immediately solve the problem! mexico with the strongest immigration laws in the world refuses to help with illegal immigration  drugs!on this vietnam war veterans day we celebrate the brave vietnam veterans and all of america’s veterans. thank you for your service to our great nation!the democrats have given us the weakest immigration laws anywhere in the world. mexico has the strongest  they make more than $100 billion a year on the u.s. therefore congress must change our weak immigration laws now  mexico must stop illegals from entering the u.s........through their country and our southern border. mexico has for many years made a fortune off of the u.s. far greater than border costs. if mexico doesn’t immediately stop all illegal immigration coming into the united states throug our southern border i will be closing.........the border or large sections of the border next week. this would be so easy for mexico to do but they just take our money and “talk.” besides we lose so much money with them especially when you add in drug trafficking etc.) that the border closing would be a good thing!had the fed not mistakenly raised interest rates especially since there is very little inflation and had they not done the ridiculously timed quantitative tightening the 3.0% gdp  stock market would have both been much higher  world markets would be in a better place!robert mueller was a hero to the radical left democrats until he ruled that there was no collusion with russia (so ridiculous to even say!). after more than two years since the “insurance policy” statement was made by a dirty cop i got the answers i wanted the truth........the problem is no matter what the radical left democrats get no matter what we give them it will never be enough. just watch they will harass  complain  resist (the theme of their movement). so maybe we should just take our victory and say no we’ve got a country to run!so funny that the new york times  the washington post got a pulitzer prize for their coverage (100% negative and fake!) of collusion with russia - and there was no collusion! so they were either duped or corrupt? in any event their prizes should be taken away by the committee!in honor of his past service to our country navy seal #eddiegallagher will soon be moved to less restrictive confinement while he awaits his day in court. process should move quickly! @foxandfriends @repralphnormanit would be so easy to fix our weak and very stupid democrat inspired immigration laws. in less than one hour and then a vote the problem would be solved. but the dems don’t care about the crime they don’t want any victory for trump and the republicans even if good for usa!mexico must use its very strong immigration laws to stop the many thousands of people trying to get into the usa. our detention areas are maxed out  we will take no more illegals. next step is to close the border! this will also help us with stopping the drug flow from mexico!“the trump administration has succeeded in dramatically raising the costs to iran for its sinister behavior at no cost to the u.s. or our allies. that’s the definition of a foreign-policy achievement.” bret stephens @nytimes  we are getting stronger all over the world watch!everybody is asking how the phony and fraudulent investigation of the no collusion no obstruction trump campaign began. we need to know for future generations to understand. this hoax should never be allowed to happen to another president or administration again!“outrageous it’s the adam schiff problem. people abusing the access to classified data to then go out in public and make allegations that didn’t prove to be true. you look at a decision to essentially investigate a political rival. who made it?” james freeman @wsjnow that the long awaited mueller report conclusions have been released most democrats and othershave gone back to the pre-witch hunt phase of their lives before collusion delusion took over. others are pretending that their former hero bob mueller no longer exists!democrats working with republicans in congress can fix the asylum and other loopholes quickly. we have a major national emergency at our border. get it done now!can you believe that the radical left democrats want to do our new and very important census report without the all important citizenship question. report would be meaningless and a waste of the $billions (ridiculous) that it costs to put together!the cost of obamacare is far too high for our great citizens. the deductibles in many cases way over $7000 make it almost worthless or unusable. good things are going to happen! @senrickscott  @senatemajldr @senjohnbarrasso  @senbillcassidyno matter what information is given to the crazed democrats from the no collusion mueller report it will never be good enough. behind closed doors the dems are laughing!democrats should stop fighting sen. david perdue’s disaster relief bill. they are blocking funding and relief for our great farmers and rural america!everybody agrees that obamacare doesn’t work. premiums  deductibles are far too high - really bad healthcare! even the dems want to replace it but with medicare for all which would cause 180 million americans to lose their beloved private health insurance. the republicans.........are developing a really great healthcare plan with far lower premiums (cost)  deductibles than obamacare. in other words it will be far less expensive  much more usable than obamacare. vote will be taken right after the election when republicans hold the senate  win..........back the house. it will be truly great healthcare that will work for america. also republicans will always support pre-existing conditions. the republican party will be known as the party of great healtcare. meantime the usa is doing better than ever  is respected again!the democrats today killed a bill that would have provided great relief to farmers and yet more money to puerto rico despite the fact that puerto rico has already been scheduled to receive more hurricane relief funding than any “place” in history. the people of puerto rico.........are great but the politicians are incompetent or corrupt. puerto rico got far more money than texas  florida combined yet their government can’t do anything right the place is a mess - nothing works. fema  the military worked emergency miracles but politicians like.........the crazed and incompetent mayor of san juan have done such a poor job  of bringing the island back to health. 91 billion dollars to puerto rico and now the dems want to give them more taking dollars away from our farmers and so many others. disgraceful!puerto rico got 91 billion dollars for the hurricane more money than has ever been gotten for a hurricane before  all their local politicians do is complain  ask for more money. the pols are grossly incompetent spend the money foolishly or corruptly  only take from usa........the best thing that ever happened to puerto rico is president donald j. trump. so many wonderful people but with such bad island leadership and with so much money wasted. cannot continue to hurt our farmers and states with these massive payments and so little appreciation!in 1998 rep.jerry nadler strongly opposed the release of the starr report on bill clinton. no information whatsoever would or could be legally released. but with the no collusion mueller report which the dems hate he wants it all. nothing will ever satisfy them! @foxandfriendsrobert mueller was a god-like figure to the democrats until he ruled no collusion in the long awaited $30000000 mueller report. now the dems don’t even acknowledge his name have become totally unhinged and would like to go through the whole process again. it won’t happen!there is no amount of testimony or document production that can satisfy jerry nadler or shifty adam schiff. it is now time to focus exclusively on properly running our great country!after many years (decades) mexico is apprehending large numbers of people at their southern border mostly from guatemala honduras and el salvador. they have all been taking u.s. money for years and doing absolutely nothing for us just like the democrats in congress!“i haven’t seen any democrats down here at the border working with us or asking to speak to any of us. they have an open invitation. we are getting overrun our facilities are overcapacity. we are at an emergency crisis.” art del cueto national border patrol council.i was never planning a vote prior to the 2020 election on the wonderful healthcare package that some very talented people are now developing for me  the republican party. it will be on full display during the election as a much better  less expensive alternative to obamacare...congress must get together and immediately eliminate the loopholes at the border! if no action border or large sections of border will close. this is a national emergency!the republican party is the party of the american dream!despite the unnecessary and destructive actions taken by the fed the economy is looking very strong the china and usmca deals are moving along nicely there is little or no inflation and usa optimism is very high!according to polling few people seem to care about the russian collusion hoax but some democrats are fighting hard to keep the witch hunt alive. they should focus on legislation or even better an investigation of how the ridiculous collusion delusion got started - so illegal!there is nothing we can ever give to the democrats that will make them happy. this is the highest level of presidential harassment in the history of our country!the new york times had no legitimate sources which would be totally illegal concerning the mueller report. in fact they probably had no sources at all! they are a fake news paper who have already been forced to apologize for their incorrect and very bad reporting on me!i am pleased to announce that jovita carranza will be nominated as the new @sbagov administrator. she will be replacing linda mcmahon who has done an outstanding job. jovita was a great treasurer of the united states – and i look forward to her joining my cabinet!“trolling the mueller report. democrats lost on collusion. now they’re inventing a coverup.” @wsjopinion  james freeman @loudobbsthe crazed and dishonest washington post again purposely got it wrong. mexico for the first time in decades is meaningfully apprehending illegals at their southern border before the long march up to the u.s. this is great and the way it should be. the big flow will stop...........however if for any reason mexico stops apprehending and bringing the illegals back to where they came from the u.s. will be forced to tariff at 25% all cars made in mexico and shipped over the border to us. if that doesn’t work which it will i will close the border...........this will supersede usmca. likewise i am looking at an economic penalty for the 500 billion dollars in illegal drugs that are shipped and smuggled through mexico and across our southern border. over 10000 americans die each year sooo many families destroyed!heading to the southern border to show a section of the new wall being built! leaving now!congratulations to brian hagedorn on his big surprise win over a well funded liberal democrat in the great state of wisconsin for a very important supreme court seat. republicans are producing big for wisconsin!i’ve employed thousands of electrical workers. they will be voting for me!the press is doing everything within their power to fight the magnificence of the phrase make america great again! they can’t stand the fact that this administration has done more than virtually any other administration in its first 2yrs. they are truly the enemy of the people!will soon be landing in calexico california to look at a portion of the new wall being built on our southern border. within two years we will have close to 400 miles built or under construction  keeping our country safe – not easy when the dems are always fighting to stop you!“the lowest average jobs number for any president since 1951 4.1%. economy doing great. if the democrats win it is all over.” @varneyco  @foxandfriends  i agree!“collusion was a hoax from day one.” @dbongino  @foxandfriendsi have not read the mueller report yet even though i have every right to do so. only know the conclusions and on the big one no collusion. likewise recommendations made to our great a.g. who found no obstruction. 13 angry trump hating dems (later brought to 18) given two..........years and $30 million and they found no collusion no obstruction. but the democrats no matter what we give them will never be satisfied. a total waste of time. as @frankluntz has just stated “enough america has had enough. what have you accomplished. public is fed up.”so let’s get this straight! there was no collusion and in fact the phony dossier was a con job that was paid for by crooked hillary and the dnc. so the 13 angry democrats were investigating an event that never happened and that was in fact a made up fraud. i just fought back....so let’s get this straight! there was no collusion and in fact the phony dossier was a con job that was paid for by crooked hillary and the dnc. so the 13 angry democrats were investigating an event that never happened and that was in fact a made up fraud. i just fought back........ against something i knew never existed collusion with russia (so ridiculous!) - no obstruction. this russia hoax must never happen to another president and law enforcement must find out how did it start?why should i be defending a fraudulent russian witch hunt. it’s about time the perpetrators of this fraud on me and the american people start defending their dishonest and treasonous acts. how and why did this terrible event begin? never forget!we have redeployed 750 agents at the southern border’s specific ports of entry in order to help with the large scale surge of illegal migrants trying to make their way into the united states. this will cause traffic  commercial delays until such time as mexico is able to use........it’s powerful common sense immigration laws to stop illegals from coming through mexico into the u.s. and removing them back to their country of origin. until mexico cleans up this ridiculous  massive migration we will be focusing on border security not ports of entry........in the meantime the democrats in congress must help the republicans (we need their votes) to end the horrible costly and foolish loopholes in our immigration laws. once that happens all will be smooth. we can never allow open borders!looks like bob mueller’s team of 13 trump haters  angry democrats are illegally leaking information to the press while the fake news media make up their own stories with or without sources - sources no longer matter to our corrupt  dishonest mainstream media they are a joke!pleased to report that the american tourist and tour guide that were abducted in uganda have been released. god bless them and their families!secretary of homeland security kirstjen nielsen will be leaving her position and i would like to thank her for her service........i am pleased to announce that kevin mcaleenan the current u.s. customs and border protection commissioner will become acting secretary for @dhsgov. i have confidence that kevin will do a great job!more apprehensions (captures)at the southern border than in many years. border patrol amazing! country is full! system has been broken for many years. democrats in congress must agree to fix loopholes - no open borders (crimes  drugs). will close southern border if necessary.......mexico must apprehend all illegals and not let them make the long march up to the united states or we will have no other choice than to close the border and/or institute tariffs. our country is full!“the reason the whole process seems so politicized is that democrats made up this complete lie about collusion ....and none of it happened.” charles hurt. the russian hoax never happened it was a fraud on the american people!“jerry nadler is not entitled to this information. he is doing this to get it to the democrat 2020 nominee.” @katiepavlichuganda must find the kidnappers of the american tourist and guide before people will feel safe in going there. bring them to justice openly and quickly!the democrats will never be satisfied no matter what they get how much they get or how many pages they get. it will never end but that’s the way life goes!congratulations to virginia - great game!the world trade organization finds that the european union subsidies to airbus has adversely impacted the united states which will now put tariffs on $11 billion of eu products! the eu has taken advantage of the u.s. on trade for many years. it will soon stop!congressman jerry nadler fought me for years on a very large development i built on the west side of manhattan. he wanted a rail yard built underneath the development or even better to stop the job. he didn’t get either  the development became very successful. nevertheless........i got along very well with jerry during the zoning and building process. then i changed course (slightly) became president and now i am dealing with congressman nadler again. some things never end but hopefully it will all go well for everyone. only time will tell!the mainstream media has never been more inaccurate or corrupt than it is today. it only seems to get worse. so much fake news!“the underlying issue remains the same without a single american being indicted for collusion with russia  that is a stunning end considering we were led to believe (fake news) that something much more dramatic would happen. why did people fall for this?” @tuckercarlson molly hthe democrats must end the loopholes on immigration. so easy to solve!so it has now been determined by 18 people that truly hate president trump that there was no collusion with russia. in fact it was an illegal investigation that should never have been allowed to start. i fought back hard against this phony  treasonous hoax!congratulations to @erictrump and @laraleatrump on the great news. so proud!i think what the democrats are doing with the border is treasonous. their open border mindset is putting our country at risk. will not let this happen!too bad that the european union is being so tough on the united kingdom and brexit. the e.u. is likewise a brutal trading partner with the united states which will change. sometimes in life you have to let people breathe before it all comes back to bite you!house democrats want to negotiate a $2 trillion spending increase but can’t even pass their own plan. we can’t afford it anyway and it’s not happening!“and the radical dems reeling in disarray as the president continues to win win and win again! the left is pretending to be shocked by a.g. william barr’s testimony before congress in which he said spying did occur on the trump 2016 campaign.” @loudobbs  @foxnewsjobless claims at 50 year low!“i don’t need to know any more. we’re done absolutely done he (mueller) tried the case. there’s no collusion.” @lindseygrahamsc  @foxandfriends  no matter what we do or give to the radical left it will never be enough!president obama’s top white house lawyer gregory b. craig was indicted yesterday on very serious charges. this is a really big story but the fake news new york times didn’t even put it on page one rather page 16. @washingtonpost not much better “tiny” page one. corrupt news!“democrats don’t like the results of the mueller report so now they’re trying everything else.”  @repdougcollins  they should stop wasting time and money and get back to real legislating especially on the border!even the democrats now say that our southern border is a crisis and a national emergency. hopefully we will not be getting any more bad (outrageous) court decisions!due to the fact that democrats are unwilling to change our very dangerous immigration laws we are indeed as reported giving strong considerations to placing illegal immigrants in sanctuary cities only........the radical left always seems to have an open borders open arms policy – so this should make them very happy!if the radical left democrats all of a sudden don’t want the illegal migrants in their sanctuary cities (no more open arms) why should others be expected to take them into their communities? go home and come into our country legally and through a system of merit!another fake story on @nbcnews that i offered pardons to homeland securiy personnel in case they broke the law regarding illegal immigration and sanctuary cities. of course this is not true. mainstream media is corrupt and getting worse if that is possible every day!in new york state democrats blocked a bill expanding college tuition for gold star families after approving aid for illegal immigrants. no wonder so many people are leaving n.y. very sad!i agree with kim jong un of north korea that our personal relationship remains very good perhaps the term excellent would be even more accurate and that a third summit would be good in that we fully understand where we each stand. north korea has tremendous potential for...........extraordinary growth economic success and riches under the leadership of chairman kim. i look forward to the day which could be soon when nuclear weapons and sanctions can be removed and then watching north korea become one of the most successful nations of the world!why should radical left democrats in congress have a right to retry and examine the $35000000 (two years in the making) no collusion mueller report when the crime committed was by crooked hillary the dnc and dirty cops? attorney general barr will make the decision!great playing by @tigerwoods (at the) @themasters. tomorrow will be a big and exciting day for golf and for sports. many fantastic players in the hunt. ratings gold - good luck to all!the new york times sanctuary cities/immigration story today was knowingly wrong on almost every fact. they never call to check for truth. their sources often don’t even exist a fraud. they will lie  cheat anyway possible to make me look bad. in 6 years they will be gone............when i won the election in 2016 the @nytimes had to beg their fleeing subscribers for forgiveness in that they covered the election (and me) so badly. they didn’t have a clue it was pathetic. they even apologized to me. but now they are even worse really corrupt reporting!i never offered pardons to homeland security officials never ordered anyone to close our southern border (although i have the absolute right to do so and may if mexico does not apprehend the illegals coming to our border) and am not “frustrated.” it is all fake  corrupt news!....so interesting to see the mayor of oakland and other sanctuary cities not want our currently “detained immigrants” after release due to the ridiculous court ordered 20 day rule. if they don’t want to serve our nation by taking care of them why should other cities  towns?democrats must change the immigration laws fast. if not sanctuary cities must immediately act to take care of the illegal immigrants - and this includes gang members drug dealers human traffickers and criminals of all shapes sizes and kinds. change the laws now!just out: the usa has the absolute legal right to have apprehended illegal immigrants transferred to sanctuary cities. we hereby demand that they be taken care of at the highest level especially by the state of california which is well known or its poor management  high taxes!if the fed had done its job properly which it has not the stock market would have been up 5000 to 10000 additional points and gdp would have been well  over 4% instead of 3%...with almost no inflation. quantitative tightening was a killer should have done the exact opposite!great masters going on right now. @tigerwoods is leading with 2 holes left to play. very exciting tune in!such a “puff piece” on nancy pelosi by @60minutes yet her leadership has passed no meaningful legislation. all they do is investigate as it turns out crimes that they instigated  committed. the mueller no collusion decision wasn’t even discussed-and she was a disaster at w.h..@stevehiltonx  “this is president trump trying to deliver on his promises while the bureaucratic machine fights his agenda. he needs populist allies. these changes are not chaos but rather progress. all this is president trump at his absolute best.” thank you steve!chinese telecom giant huawei hires former obama cyber security official as a lobbyist. this is not good or acceptable! @foxnews @stevehiltonxwhat do i know about branding maybe nothing (but i did become president!) but if i were boeing i would fix the boeing 737 max add some additional great features  rebrand the plane with a new name.no product has suffered like this one. but again what the hell do i know?mueller and the a.g. based on mueller findings (and great intelligence) have already ruled no collusion no obstruction. these were crimes committed by crooked hillary the dnc dirty cops and others! investigate the investigators!congress should come back to d.c. now and fix the immigration laws!before nancy who has lost all control of congress and is getting nothing done decides to defend her leader rep. omar she should look at the anti-semitic anti-israel and ungrateful u.s. hate statements omar has made. she is out of control except for her control of nancy!they spied on my campaign (we will never forget)!the radical left democrats will never be satisfied with anything we give them. they will always resist and obstruct!mark morgan president obama’s border patrol chief gave the following message to me: “president trump stay the course.” i agree and believe it or not we are making great progress with a system that has been broken for many years!those illegal immigrants who can no longer be legally held (congress must fix the laws and loopholes) will be subject to homeland security given to sanctuary cities and states!the mueller report which was written by 18 angry democrats who also happen to be trump haters (and clinton supporters) should have focused on the people who spied on my 2016 campaign and others who fabricated the whole russia hoax. that is never forget the crime.........since there was no collusion why was there an investigation in the first place! answer - dirty cops dems and crooked hillary!spoke to @tigerwoods to congratulate him on the great victory he had in yesterday’s @themasters  to inform him that because of his incredible success  comeback in sports (golf) and more importantly life i will be presenting him with the presidential medal of freedom!so horrible to watch the massive fire at notre dame cathedral in paris. perhaps flying water tankers could be used to put it out. must act quickly!the forgotten voters of the 2016 election are now doing great. the steel industry is rebuilding and expanding at a pace that it hasn’t seen in decades. our country has one of the best economies in many years perhaps ever. unemployment numbers best in 51 years. wow!god bless the people of france!a must read andy mccarthy’s column today “dirty dealings of dirt devils who concocted trump-russia probe.” the greatest scam in political history. if the mainstream media were honest which they are not this story would be bigger and more important than watergate. someday!no collusion - no obstruction!so weird to watch crazy bernie on @foxnews. not surprisingly @bretbaier and the “audience” was so smiley and nice. very strange and now we have @donnabrazile?just signed a critical bill to formalize drought contingency plans for the colorado river. thanks to @senmcsallyaz for getting it done. big deal for arizona!many trump fans  signs were outside of the @foxnews studio last night in the now thriving (thank you president trump) bethlehem pennsylvania for the interview with crazy bernie sanders. big complaints about not being let in-stuffed with bernie supporters. what’s with @foxnews?bernie sanders and wife should pay the pre-trump taxes on their almost $600000 in income. he is always complaining about these big tax cuts except when it benefits him. they made a fortune off of trump but so did everyone else - and that’s a good thing not a bad thing!i believe it will be crazy bernie sanders vs. sleepy joe biden as the two finalists to run against maybe the best economy in the history of our country (and many other great things)! i look forward to facing whoever it may be. may god rest their soul!wow! fbi made 11 payments to fake dossier’s discredited author trump hater christopher steele. @oann  @judicialwatch  the witch hunt has been a total fraud on your president and the american people! it was brought to you by dirty cops crooked hillary and the dnc.democrats in congress must return from their vacations and change the immigration laws or the border despite the great job being done by border patrol will only get worse. big sections of wall now being built!just had a wonderful conversation with @pontifex francis offering condolences from the people of the united states for the horrible and destructive fire at notre dame cathedral. i offered the help of our great experts on renovation and construction as i did....the greatest political hoax of all time! crimes were committed by crooked dirty cops and dnc/the democrats.presidential harassment!attorney general william barr’s press conference today at 9:30 am et. watch on @foxnews @oann“donald trump was being framed he fought back. that is not obstruction.” @jessebwatters  i had the right to end the whole witch hunt if i wanted. i could have fired everyone including mueller if i wanted. i chose not to. i had the right to use executive privilege. i didn’t!it was a really great day for america! a special evening tonight on @tuckercarlson @seanhannity   @ingrahamangle will be very interesting!anything the russians did concerning the 2016 election was done while obama was president. he was told about it and did nothing! most importantly the vote was not affected.“if dozens of federal prosecutors spent two years trying to charge you with a crime and found they couldn’t it would mean there wasn’t any evidence you did it - and that’s what happened here - that’s what we just learned from the mueller report.”  @tuckercarlson“the mueller report is perhaps the single most humiliating thing that has ever happened to the white house press in the history of this country. they know they lied...many reporters lied about russia collusion and so much more. clapper  brennan all lies” @tuckercarlsonstatements are made about me by certain people in the crazy mueller report in itself written by 18 angry democrat trump haters which are fabricated  totally untrue. watch out for people that take so-called “notes” when the notes never existed until needed. because i never.......agreed to testify it was not necessary for me to respond to statements made in the “report” about me some of which are total bullshit  only given to make the other person look good (or me to look bad). this was an illegally started hoax that never should have happened a.......big fat waste of time energy and money - $30000000 to be exact. it is now finally time to turn the tables and bring justice to some very sick and dangerous people who have committed very serious crimes perhaps even spying or treason. this should never happen again!despite the fact that the mueller report should not have been authorized in the first place  was written as nastily as possible by 13 (18) angry democrats who were true trump haters including highly conflicted bob mueller himself the end result is no collusion no obstruction!the fake news media is doing everything possible to stir up and anger the pols and as many people as possible seldom mentioning the fact that the mueller report had as its principle conclusion the fact that there was no collusion with russia. the russia hoax is dead!united states weekly jobless claims just hit a 50 year low. the economy is doing great!the end result of the greatest witch hunt in u.s. political history is no collusion with russia (and no obstruction). pretty amazing!good night of television! 8:00 pm @wattersworld  9:00 pm @judgejeanine with interview of @rudygiuliani followed by greg g. honest commentary is always nice!heartfelt condolences from the people of the united states to the people of sri lanka on the horrible terrorist attacks on churches and hotels that have killed at least 138 million people and badly injured 600 more. we stand ready to help!happy easter! i have never been happier or more content because your country is doing so well with an economy that is the talk of the world and may be stronger than it has ever been before. have a great day!138 people have been killed in sri lanka with more that 600 badly injured in a terrorist attack on churches and hotels. the united states offers heartfelt condolences to the great people of sri lanka. we stand ready to help!do you believe this? the new york times op-ed: media and democrats owe trump an apology. well they got that one right!the trump haters and angry democrats who wrote the mueller report were devastated by the no collusion finding! nothing but a total “hit job” which should never have been allowed to start in the first place!despite no collusion no obstruction the radical left democrats do not want to go on to legislate for the good of the people but only to investigate and waste time. this is costing our country greatly and will cost the dems big time in 2020!can you believe that i had to go through the worst and most corrupt political witch hunt in the history of the united states (no collusion) when it was the “other side” that illegally created the diversionary  criminal event and even spied on my campaign? disgraceful!how do you impeach a republican president for a crime that was committed by the democrats? make america great again!saudi arabia and others in opec will more than make up the oil flow difference in our now full sanctions on iranian oil. iran is being given very bad advice by @johnkerry and people who helped him lead the u.s. into the very bad iran nuclear deal. big violation of logan act?only high crimes and misdemeanors can lead to impeachment. there were no crimes by me (no collusion no obstruction) so you can’t impeach. it was the democrats that committed the crimes not your republican president! tables are finally turning on the witch hunt!my friend herman cain a truly wonderful man has asked me not to nominate him for a seat on the federal reserve board. i will respect his wishes. herman is a great american who truly loves our country!spoke to president maithripala sirisena of sri lanka yesterday to inform him that the united states stands by him and his country in the fight against terrorism. also expressed condolences on behalf of myself and the people of the united states.spoke to prime minister ranil wickremesinghe of sri lanka this morning to inform him that the united states stands by him and his country in the fight against terrorism. also expressed condolences on behalf of myself and the people of the united states!spoke to the prime minister of italy giuseppe conte mostly concerning immigration taxes trade and the economy of both of our countries. very good call!isn’t it amazing that the people who were closest to me by far and knew the campaign better than anyone were never even called to testify before mueller. the reason is that the 18 angry democrats knew they would all say ‘no collusion’ and only very good things!just spoke to @loudobbs. will be doing a very interesting show tonight at 7:00 p.m. eastern on @foxbusiness!paul krugman of the fake news new york times has lost all credibility as has the times itself with his false and highly inaccurate writings on me. he is obsessed with hatred just as others are obsessed with how stupid he is. he said market would crash only record highs!i wonder if the new york times will apologize to me a second time as they did after the 2016 election. but this one will have to be a far bigger   better apology. on this one they will have to get down on their knees  beg for forgiveness-they are truly the enemy of the people!i will be going to green bay wisconsin for a really big rally on saturday evening. big crowd expected much to talk about. make america great again!the radical left democrats together with their leaders in the fake news media have gone totally insane! i guess that means that the republican agenda is working. stay tuned for more!in the “old days” if you were president and you had a good economy you were basically immune from criticism. remember “it’s the economy stupid.” today i have as president perhaps the greatest economy in history...and to the mainstream media it means nothing. but it will!sorry to say but @foxandfriends is by far the best of the morning political shows on television. it rightfully has by far the highest  ratings not even close. morning psycho (joe) who helped get me elected in 2016 by having me on (free) all the time has nosedived too angry.......dumb and sick. a really bad show with low ratings - and will only get worse. cnn has been a proven and long term ratings and beyond disaster. in fact it rewarded chris cuomo with a now unsuccessful prime time slot despite his massive failure in the morning. only on cnn!“harley davidson has struggled with tariffs with the eu currently paying 31%. they’ve had to move production overseas to try and offset some of that tariff that they’ve been hit with which will rise to 66% in june of 2021.” @mariabartiromo so unfair to u.s. we will reciprocate!“the best thing ever to happen to twitter is donald trump.” @mariabartiromo  so true but they don’t treat me well as a republican. very discriminatory hard for people to sign on. constantly taking people off list. big complaints from many people. different names-over 100 m..........but should be much higher than that if twitter wasn’t playing their political games. no wonder congress wants to get involved - and they should. must be more and fairer companies to get out the word!the wall is being rapidly built! the economy is great! our country is respected again!keep america great!you mean the stock market hit an all-time record high today and they’re actually talking impeachment!? will i ever be given credit for anything by the fake news media or radical liberal dems? no collusion!“former cia analyst larry johnson accuses united kingdom intelligence of helping obama administration spy on the 2016 trump presidential campaign.” @oann wow! it is now just a question of time before the truth comes out and when it does it will be a beauty!the american people deserve to know who is in this country. yesterday the supreme court took up the census citizenship question a really big deal. make america great again!a very big caravan of over 20000 people started up through mexico. it has been reduced in size by mexico but is still coming. mexico must apprehend the remainder or we will be forced to close that section of the border  call up the military. the coyotes  cartels have weapons!mexico’s soldiers recently pulled guns on our national guard soldiers probably as a diversionary tactic for drug smugglers on the border. better not happen again! we are now sending armed soldiers to the border. mexico is not doing nearly enough in apprehending  returning!the mueller report despite being written by angry democrats and trump haters and with unlimited money behind it ($35000000) didn’t lay a glove on me. i did nothing wrong. if the partisan dems ever tried to impeach i would first head to the u.s. supreme court. not only...........are there no “high crimes and misdemeanors” there are no crimes by me at all. all of the crimes were committed by crooked hillary the dems the dnc and dirty cops - and we caught them in the act! we waited for mueller and won so now the dems look to congress as last hope!can anyone comprehend what a great job border patrol and law enforcement is doing on our southern border. so far this year they have apprehended 418000 plus illegal immigrants way up from last year. mexico is doing very little for us. dems in congress must act now!no collusion no obstruction - there has never been a president who has been more transparent. millions of pages of documents were given to the mueller angry dems plus i allowed everyone to testify including w.h. counsel. i didn’t have to do this but now they want more.........congress has no time to legislate they only want to continue the witch hunt which i have already won. they should start looking at the criminals who are already very well known to all. this was a rigged system - we will drain the swamp!i didn’t call bob costa of the washington post he called me (returned his call)!  just more fake news.rep. occasio-cortez is correct the va is not broken it is doing great. but that is only because of the trump administration. we got veterans choice  accountability passed. “president trump deserves a lot of credit.” dan caldwell concerned veterans of americarep. alexandria ocasio-cortez is correct the va is not broken it is

americathe great state of tennessee is so close to passing school choice. all of our nation’s children regardless of background deserve a shot at achieving the american dream! time to get this done so important!as has been incorrectly reported by the fake news media i never told then white house counsel don mcgahn to fire robert mueller even though i had the legal right to do so. if i wanted to fire mueller i didn’t need mcgahn to do it i could have done it myself. nevertheless........mueller was not fired and was respectfully allowed to finish his work on what i and many others say was an illegal investigation (there was no crime) headed by a trump hater who was highly conflicted and a group of 18 very angry democrats. drain the swamp!.....despite the fact that the mueller report was “composed” by trump haters and angry democrats who had unlimited funds and human resources the end result was no collusion no obstruction. amazing!welcome to the race sleepy joe. i only hope you have the intelligence long in doubt to wage a successful primary campaign. it will be nasty - you will be dealing with people who truly have some very sick  demented ideas. but if you make it i will see you at the starting gate!i will be interviewed on @seanhannity at 9:00 pm.  in 5 minutes - enjoy!no money was paid to north korea for otto warmbier not two million dollars not anything else. this is not the obama administration that paid 1.8 billion dollars for four hostages or gave five terroist hostages plus who soon went back to battle for traitor sgt. bergdahl!“president donald j. trump is the greatest hostage negotiator that i know of in the history of the united states. 20 hostages many in impossible circumstances have been released in last two years. no money was paid.” cheif hostage negotiator usa!weirdo tom steyer who didn’t have the “guts” or money to run for president is still trying to remain relevant by putting himself on ads begging for impeachment. he doesn’t mention the

agent who stopped the shooter at the synagogue in poway california. he may have been off duty but his talents for law enforcement weren’t!thank you to brilliant and highly respected attorney alan dershowitz for destroying the very dumb legal argument of “judge” andrew napolitano........ever since andrew came to my office to ask that i appoint him to the u.s. supreme court and i said no he has been very hostile! also asked for pardon for his friend. a good “pal” of low ratings shepard smith.the democratic national committee sometimes referred to as the dnc is again working its magic in its quest to destroy crazy bernie sanders........for the more traditional but not very bright sleepy joe biden. here we go again bernie but this time please show a little more anger and indignation when you get screwed!will be interviewed by @mariabartiromo on @foxnews at 10:00 am. talking about the southern border and how the dems must act fast to change our pathetic immigration laws. will be tough watch!i spoke at length yesterday to rabbi yisroel goldstein chabad  of poway where i extended my warmest condolences to him and all affected by the shooting in california. what a great guy. he had a least one finger blown off and all he wanted to do is help others. very special!the nra is under siege by cuomo and the new york state a.g. who are illegally using the state’s legal apparatus to take down and destroy this very important organization  others. it must get its act together quickly stop the internal fighting  get back to greatness - fast!....people are fleeing new york state because of high taxes and yes even oppression of sorts. they didn’t even put up a fight against salt - could have won. so much litigation. the nra should leave and fight from the outside of this very difficult to deal with (unfair) state!i’ll never get the support of dues crazy union leadership those people who rip-off their membership with ridiculously high dues medical and other expenses while being paid a fortune. but the members love trump. they look at our record economy tax  reg cuts military etc. win!the media (fake news) is pushing sleepy joe hard. funny i’m only here because of biden  obama. they didn’t do the job and now you have trump who is getting it done - big time!sleepy joe biden is having his first rally in the great state of pennsylvania. he obviously doesn’t know that pennsylvania is having one of the best economic years in its history with lowest unemployment ever a now thriving steel industry (that was dead)  great future!........the dues sucking firefighters leadership will always support democrats even though the membership wants me. some things never change!bob mueller was a great hero to the radical left democrats. now that the mueller report is finished with a finding of no collusion  no obstruction (based on a review of report by our highly respected a.g.) the dems are going around saying “bob who sorry don’t know the man.”the new york times has apologized for the terrible anti-semitic cartoon but they haven’t apologized to me for this or all of the fake and corrupt news they print on a daily basis. they have reached the lowest level of “journalism” and certainly a low point in @nytimes history!the coyotes and drug cartels are in total control of the mexico side of the southern border. they have labs nearby where they make drugs to sell into the u.s. mexico one of the most dangerous country’s in the world must eradicate this problem now. also stop the march to u.s.if the democrats don’t give us the votes to change our weak ineffective and dangerous immigration laws we must fight hard for these votes in the 2020 election!we have 1800 isis prisoners taken hostage in our final battles to destroy 100% of the caliphate in syria. decisions are now being made as to what to do with these dangerous prisoners........european countries are not helping at all even though this was very much done for their benefit. they are refusing to take back prisoners from their specific countries. not good!china is adding great stimulus to its economy while at the same time keeping interest rates low. our federal reserve has incessantly lifted interest rates even though inflation is very low and instituted a very big dose of quantitative tightening. we have the potential to go.......up like a rocket if we did some lowering of rates like one point and some quantitative easing. yes we are doing very well at 3.2% gdp but with our wonderfully low inflation we could be setting major records  at the same time make our national debt start to look small!if cuban troops and militia do not immediately cease military and other operations for the purpose of causing death and destruction to the constitution of venezuela a full and complete........embargo together with highest-level sanctions will be placed on the island of cuba. hopefully all cuban soldiers will promptly and peacefully return to their island!“the democrats can’t come to grips with the fact that there was no collusion there was no conspiracy there was no obstruction. what we should be focused on is what’s been going on in our government at the highest levels of the fbi....” senator josh hawleyi am overriding the decommission order of the magnificent aircraft carrier harry s. truman built in 1998 (fairly new) and considered one of the largest and finest in the world. it will be updated at a fraction of the cost of a new one (which also are being built)!gallup poll: 56% of americans rate their financial situation as excellent or good. this is the highest number since 2002 and up 10 points since 2016.“no president in history has endured such vicious personal attacks by political opponents. still the president’s record is unparalleled.” @loudobbscongress must change the immigration laws now dems won’t act. wall is being built - 400 miles by end of next year. mexico must stop the march to border! @foxandfriendswhy didn’t president obama do something about russia in september (before november election) when told by the fbi? he did nothing and had no intention of doing anything!no collusion no obstruction. besides how can you have obstruction when not only was there no collusion (by trump) but the bad actions were done by the “other” side? the greatest con-job in the history of american politics!....and deregulation which have produced non-inflationary prosperity for all americans. i’ve asked steve to work with me toward future economic growth in our country.ok so after two years of hard work and each party trying their best to make the other party look as bad as possible it’s time to get back to business. the mueller report strongly stated that there was no collusion with russia (of course) and in fact they were rebuffed........at every turn in attempts to gain access. but now republicans and democrats must come together for the good of the american people. no more costly  time consuming investigations. lets do immigration (border) infrastructure much lower drug prices  much more - and do it now!finally mainstream media is getting involved - too “hot” to avoid. pulitzer prize anyone? the new york times on front page (finally) “details effort to spy on trump campaign.” @foxandfriends  this is bigger than watergate but the reverse!had a long and very good conversation with president putin of russia. as i have always said long before the witch hunt started getting along with russia china and everyone is a good thing not a bad thing........we discussed trade venezuela ukraine north korea nuclear arms control and even the “russian hoax.” very productive talk!fred keller of the great state of pennsylvania has been an outstanding state rep. now he is running as the republican nominee for congress and has my complete and total endorsement. strong on crime second amendment military vets and healthcare. he will do a fantastic job!i am continuing to monitor the censorship of american citizens on social media platforms. this is the united states of america — and we have what’s known as freedom of speech! we are monitoring and watching closely!!the wonderful diamond and silk have been treated so horribly by facebook. they work so hard and what has been done to them is very sad - and we’re looking into. it’s getting worse and worse for

@iagovernor @govparsonmo @govpritzker and the local officials managing the impacts of the destructive flooding.“they wanted to know what trump was up to with the russians - which of course is nonsense. this whole thing was a complete setup.” george papadopoulos to @seanhannitythere is nothing easy about a usa infrastructure plan especially when our great country has spent an astounding 7 trillion dollars in the middle east over the last 19 years but i am looking hard at a bipartisan plan of 1 to 2 trillion dollars. badly needed!when will the radical left wing media apologize to me for knowingly getting the russia collusion delusion story so wrong? the real story is about to happen! why is @nytimes @washingtonpost @cnn @msnbc allowed to be on twitter  facebook. much of what they do is fake news!anything in this very interesting world is possible but i believe that kim jong un fully realizes the great economic potential of north korea  will do nothing to interfere or end it. he also knows that i am with him  does not want to break his promise to me. deal will happen!very good call yesterday with president putin of russia. tremendous potential for a good/great relationship with russia despite what you read and see in the fake news media. look how they have misled you on “russia collusion.” the world can be a better and safer place. nice!how can it be possible that james woods (and many others) a strong but responsible conservative voice is banned from twitter? social media  fake news media together with their partner the democrat party have no idea the problems they are causing for themselves. very unfair!the kentuky derby decision was not a good one. it was a rough and tumble race on a wet and sloppy track actually a beautiful thing to watch. only in these days of political correctness could such an overturn occur. the best horse did not win the kentucky derby - not even close!i am pleased to inform all of those that believe in a strong fair and sound immigration policy that mark morgan will be joining the trump administration as the head of our hard working men and women of ice. mark is a true believer and american patriot. he will do a great job!the kentucky derby decision was not a good one. it was a rough  tumble race on a wet and sloppy track actually a beautiful thing to watch. only in these days of political correctness could such an overturn occur. the best horse did not win the kentucky derby - not even close!....of additional goods sent to us by china remain untaxed but will be shortly at a rate of 25%. the tariffs paid to the usa have had little impact on product cost mostly borne by china. the trade deal with china continues but too slowly as they attempt to renegotiate. no!after spending more than $35000000 over a two year period interviewing 500 people using 18 trump hating angry democrats  49 fbi agents - all culminating in a more than 400 page report showing no collusion - why would the democrats in congress now need robert mueller...........to testify. are they looking for a redo because they hated seeing the strong no collusion conclusion? there was no crime except on the other side (incredibly not covered in the report) and no obstruction. bob mueller should not testify. no redos for the dems!“the report sounded an awful lot as being comeyesque in other words i’m not going to charge this person (there wasn’t even close to being a crime) but i’m going to criticize him on the way out the door. that’s unfortunate because it’s stepping outside of the role.” robert ray“this is not congressional

thing that can prevent president trump from re-election in 2020.” @oann  in other words dems can’t win the election fairly. you can’t impeach a president for creating the best economy in our country’s history.....also there are “no high crimes  misdemeanors” no collusion no conspiracy no obstruction. all the crimes are on the other side and that’s what the dems should be looking at but they won’t. nevertheless the tables are turning!the united states has been losing for many years 600 to 800 billion dollars a year on trade. with china we lose 500 billion dollars. sorry we’re not going to be doing that anymore!scott walker is 100% correct when he says that the republicans must wake up to the democrats state by state power grab. they play very dirty actually like never before. don’t allow them to get away with what they are doing!puerto rico has been given more money by congress for hurricane disaster relief 91 billion dollars than any state in the history of the u.s. as an example florida got $12 billion  texas $39 billion for their monster hurricanes. now the democrats are saying no relief to..........alabama iowa nebraska georgia south carolina north carolina and others

tax losses in almost all cases. much was non monetary. sometimes considered “tax shelter” ..........you would get it by building or even buying. you always wanted to show losses for tax purposes....almost all real estate developers did - and often re-negotiate with banks it was sport. additionally the very old information put out is a highly inaccurate fake news hit job!the reason for the china pullback  attempted renegotiation of the trade deal is the sincere hope that they will be able to “negotiate” with joe biden or one of the very weak democrats and thereby continue to ripoff the united states (($500 billion a year)) for years to come........guess what that’s not going to happen! china has just informed us that they (vice-premier) are now coming to the u.s. to make a deal. we’ll see but i am very happy with over $100 billion a year in tariffs filling u.s. coffers...great for u.s. not good for china!“shouldn’t 2015 and 2016 be revealed how intelligence agencies

to rush - as tariffs are now being paid to the united states by china of 25% on 250 billion dollars worth of goods  products. these massive payments go directly to the treasury of the u.s...........the process has begun to place additional tariffs at 25% on the remaining 325 billion dollars. the u.s. only sells china approximately 100 billion dollars of goods  products a very big imbalance. with the over 100 billion dollars in tariffs that we take in we will buy.....tariffs will bring in far more wealth to our country than even a phenomenal deal of the traditional kind. also much easier  quicker to do. our farmers will do better faster and starving nations can now be helped. waivers on some products will be granted or go to new source!....if we bought 15 billion dollars

because the mueller report said there was no collusion they only want to talk about obstruction even though there was no obstruction or no crime - except for the crimes committed by the other side!i think that china felt they were being beaten so badly in the recent negotiation that they may as well wait around for the next election 2020 to see if they could get lucky  have a democrat win - in which case they would continue to rip-off the usa for $500 billion a year....i was not going to fire bob mueller and did not fire bob mueller. in fact he was allowed to finish his report with unprecedented help from the trump administration. actually lawyer don mcgahn had a much better chance of being fired than mueller. never a big fan!“the democrats have nothing. just want to distract from this president. the fbi was not doing its job the state department was covering things up everyday for hillary. at the end of the day they’re fearful of what they did and should be fearful. this

under a sick  unlawful investigation concerning what has become known as the russian........hoax. my campaign was being seriously spied upon by intel agencies and the democrats. this never happened before in american history and it all turned out to be a total scam a witch hunt that yielded no collusion no obstruction. this must never be allowed to happen again!big attacks on republicans and conservatives by social media. not good!we are right where we want to be with china. remember they broke the deal with us  tried to renegotiate. we will be taking in tens of billions of dollars in tariffs from china. buyers of product can make it themselves in the usa (ideal) or buy it from non-tariffed countries.......we will then spend (match or better) the money that china may no longer be spending with our great patriot farmers (agriculture) which is a small percentage of total tariffs received and distribute the food to starving people in nations around the world! great! #magathe democrats new and pathetically untrue sound bite is that we are in a “constitutional crisis.” they and their partner the fake news media are all told to say this as loud and as often as possible. they are a sad joke! we may have the strongest economy in our history best.......employment numbers ever low taxes  regulations a rebuilt military  v.a. many great new judges  so much more. but we have had a giant scam perpetrated upon our nation a witch hunt a treasonous hoax. that is the constitutional crisis  hopefully guilty people will pay!ever since the mueller report showed no collusion  no obstruction the dems have been working overtime to damage me and the republican party by issuing over 80 demands for documents and testimonies and with no reason. that’s all they want to do - don’t care about anything else!when the mueller report came out showing no collusion with russia (of course) it was supposed to be over back to work for the people. but the dems have gone “nuts” and it has actually gotten worse! hope the republicans win back the house in 2020 or little will get done!the “constitutional crisis” is the democrats refusing to work. let them start by fixing the mess that their immigration laws have caused at the southern border.“even director james clapper admits that the fbi actions against the trump presidential campaign do in fact meet the definition of spying

- it is booming! we placed a 25% tariff on “dumped” steel from china  other countries and we now have a big and growing industry. we had to save steel for our defense and auto industries both of which are coming back strong!china buys much less from us than we buy from them by almost 500 billion dollars so we are in a fantastic position. make your product at home in the usa and there is no tariff. you can also buy from a non-tariffed country instead of china. many companies are leaving china.........so that they will be more competitive for usa buyers. we are now a much bigger economy than china and have substantially increased in size since the great 2016 election. we are the “piggy bank” that everyone wants to raid and take advantage of. no more!we can make a deal with china tomorrow

could have made. will be taking in.....billions of dollars and moving jobs back to the usa where they belong. other countries are already negotiating with us because they don’t want this to happen to them. they must be a part of usa action. this should have been done by our leaders many years ago. enjoy!when the time is right we will make a deal with china. my respect and friendship with president xi is unlimited but as i have told him many times before this must be a great deal for the united states or it just doesn’t make any sense. we have to be allowed to make up some.........of the tremendous ground we have lost to china on trade since the ridiculous one sided formation of the wto. it will all happen and much faster than people think!our great patriot farmers will be one of the biggest beneficiaries of what is happening now. hopefully china will do us the honor of continuing to buy our great farm product the best but if not your country will be making up the difference based on a very high china buy..........this money will come from the massive tariffs being paid to the united states for allowing china and others to do business with us. the farmers have been “forgotten”

policies are covered. i’m sure that iran will want to talk soon.the dems are getting another beauty to join their group. bill de blasio of nyc considered the worst mayor in the u.s. will supposedly be

new supreme court justices the mexico city policy and a whole new  positive attitude about the right to life. the radical left with late term abortion (and worse) is imploding on this issue. we must

judges and 2 supreme court justices got rid of the disastrous individual mandate  will protect pre-existing....never a fan of @justinamash a total lightweight who opposes me and some of our great republican ideas and policies just for the sake of getting his name out there through controversy. if he actually read the biased mueller report “composed” by 18 angry dems who hated trump........he would see that it was nevertheless strong on no collusion and ultimately no obstruction...anyway how do you obstruct when there is no crime and in fact the crimes were committed by the other side? justin is a loser who sadly plays right into our opponents hands!watched some of the fake news political shows this morning and continue to be amazed at how every question is asked in the most negative way. the mainstream media should be ashamed of itself - but the good news is that the usa is wise to your game of dishonesty and deception!our economy and jobs market is booming the best in the world and in our country’s history - and we have just started!false reporting yesterday. “there are no plans to send migrants to northern or coastal border facilities including florida.” @foxnews

believe that @foxnews is wasting airtime on mayor pete as chris wallace likes to call him. fox is moving more and more to the losing (wrong) side in covering the dems. they got dumped from the democrats boring debates and they just want in. they forgot the people.....the failing new york times (it will pass away when i leave office in 6 years) and others of the fake news media keep writing phony stories about how i didn’t use many banks because they didn’t want to do business with me. wrong! it is because i didn’t need money. very old....fashioned but true. when you don’t need or want money you don’t need or want banks. banks have always been available to me they want to make money. fake media only says this to disparage and always uses unnamed sources (because their sources don’t even exist)..........now the new big story is that trump made a lot of money and buys everything for cash he doesn’t need banks. but where did he get all of that cash? could it be russia? no i built a great business and don’t need banks but if i did they would be there...and deutschebank...........was very good and highly professional to deal with - and if for any reason i didn’t like them i would have gone elsewhere....there was always plenty of money around and banks to choose from. they would be very happy to take my money. fake news!two tweets missing from last batch probably a twitter error. no time for a redo! only the dems get redos!“we have a booming economy and working people are making gains that they haven’t seen in decades.”  stuart varney @foxandfriendswhy are the democrats

them. perhaps they could even run for president!looks like bernie sanders is history. sleepy joe biden is pulling ahead and think about it i’m only here because of sleepy joe and the man who took him off the 1% trash heap president o! china wants sleepy joe badly!the fake news put out a typically false statement without any knowledge that the united states was trying to set up a negotiation with iran. this is a false report........iran will call us if and when they are ever ready. in the meantime their economy continues to collapse - very sad for the iranian people!megan king who is running for superior court judge in the pennsylvania election has my full and total endorsement. she is tough on crime and fully understands all aspects of the law. vote for megan tomorrow (tuesday).i am very disappointed that mexico is doing virtually nothing to stop illegal immigrants from coming to our southern border where everyone knows that because of the democrats our immigration laws are totally flawed  broken......mexico’s attitude is that people from other countries including mexico should have the right to flow into the u.s.  that u.s. taxpayers should be responsible for the tremendous costs associated w/this illegal migration. mexico is wrong and i will soon be giving a response!pennsylvania - don’t forget to get out and vote today for republican fred keller for congress. fred is strong on crime second amendment military vets and healthcare. he has my complete and total endorsement!i am pleased to announce my nomination of barbara barrett of arizona and former chairman of the aerospace corporation to be the next secretary of the air force. she will be an outstanding secretary! #flyfightwinso even though i didn’t have to do it with presidential privilege i allowed everyone to testify including white house counsel don mcgahn (for over 30 hours) to robert mueller and the 18 angry trump-hating democrats and they arrived........at a conclusion of no collusion and no obstruction! the dems were unhappy with the outcome of the $40m mueller report so now they want a do-over.shahira knight has done a wonderful job as my legislative affairs director at the white house. she was outstanding for us and for our country - will be a tremendous success in the private sector!after spending 40 million dollars reviewing 1.4 million pages of documents  interviewing 500 people with the total support of the white house the mueller report was a big disappointment to the democrats so they want a do over. it doesn’t work that way-so bad for our country!the democrats are on a fishing expedition wanting to interview the same people and see the same things as we just went through for two years with robert mueller and the 18 angry dems. never happened to a president before. never even happened to president obama!john brennan on the mueller probe “i don’t know if i received bad information but i think i suspected that there was more than there actually was.” wow he admits he was wrong! congress should go back to work on drug prices etc.congratulations to governor @mattbevin on winning the republican primary for governor tonight in the great state of kentucky. matt you are doing a fantastic job!everything the democrats are asking me for is based on an illegally started investigation that failed for them especially when the mueller report came back with a no collusion finding. now they say impeach president trump even though he did nothin wrong while they “fish!”after two years of an expensive and comprehensive witch hunt the democrats don’t like the result and they want a do over. in other words the witch hunt continues!the democrats are getting zero work done in congress. all they are focused on is trying to prove the mueller report wrong the witch hunt!presidential harassment!without the illegal witch hunt my poll numbers especially because of our historically “great” economy would be at 65%. too bad! the greatest hoax in american history.much of the wall being built at the southern border is a complete demolition and rebuilding of old and worthless barriers with a brand new wall and footings. problem is the haters say that is not a new wall but rather a renovation. wrong and we must build where most needed....also tremendous work is being done on pure renovation - fixing existing walls that are in bad condition and ineffective and bringing them to a very high standard!everybody including me thought that when the 40 million dollar mueller report was released with no collusion and no obstruction (of a crime caused by others) that was the end. but no the democrats want to keep it going in an effort to help them in 2020. bad for the country!“the democrats are in danger of becoming irrelevant because of their decision to keep taking the country on wild goose chases. they ought to start governing. you know for a change.”  michael goodwin @newyorkpost“he (jerry nadler) wants a show. he wants to use mr. mcgahn as a prop to spend three hours claiming that mr. trump tried to obstruct the mueller investigation. yet mr. mueller wasn’t obstructed in any way his copious report was released for all to see  there was no collusion....between russia and the trump campaign. mr. mcgahn can be forgiven for declining the honor of appearing in mr. nadler’s pseudo-impeachment drama.” wall street journal editorial boardtoday - may 21 2019as i have long been saying and has now been proven out this is a witch hunt against the republican party and myself and it was the other side that caused the problem not us!so sad that nancy pelosi and chuck schumer will never be able to see or understand the great promise of our country. they can continue the witch hunt which has already cost $40m and been a tremendous waste of time and energy for everyone in america or get back to work........but they really want a do-over! you can’t investigate and legislate simultaneously - it just doesn’t work that way. you can’t go down two tracks at the same time. let chuck nancy jerry adam and all of the rest finish playing their games........in the meantime my administration is achieving things that have never been done before including unleashing perhaps the greatest economy in our country’s history........democrat leadership is tearing the united states apart but i will continue to set records for the american people – and nancy thank you so much for your prayers i know you truly mean it!in a letter to her house colleagues nancy pelosi said: “president trump had a temper tantrum for us all to see.” this is not true. i was purposely very polite and calm much as i was minutes later with the press in the rose garden. can be easily proven. it is all such a lie!democrats don’t want to fix the loopholes at the border. they don’t want to do anything. open borders and crime!the democrats are getting nothing done in congress. all of their effort is about a re-do of the mueller report which didn’t turn out the way they wanted. it is not possible for them to investigate and legislate at the same time. their heart is not into infrastructure lower.........drug prices pre-existing conditions and our great vets. all they are geared up to do six committees is squander time day after day trying to find anything which will be bad for me. a pure fishing expedition like this never happened before  it should never happen again!the democrats have become known as the do nothing party!rex tillerson a man who is “dumb as a rock” and totally ill prepared and ill equipped to be secretary of state made up a story (he got fired) that i was out-prepared by vladimir putin at a meeting in hamburg germany. i don’t think putin would agree. look how the u.s. is doing!i was extremely calm yesterday with my meeting with pelosi and schumer knowing that they would say i was raging which they always do along with their partner the fake news media. well so many stories about the meeting use the rage narrative anyway - fake  corrupt press!when the democrats in congress refinish for the 5th time their fake work on their very disappointing mueller report finding they will have the time to get the real work of the people done. move quickly!.@nws and @usacehq are monitoring the damaging storms and flooding in oklahoma. listen to the warnings of your local officials and stay safe. we are with you!congratulations to prime minister @narendramodi and his bjp party on their big election victory! great things are in store for the us-india partnership with the return of pm modi at the helm. i look forward to continuing our important work together!@foxnews poll: a majority of americans want the democrats to stop investigating president trump. the mueller report said very strongly no collusion which led to no obstruction. the dems can’t get over 2016 or the conclusive mueller findings. they are now the do nothing party!“today at the request and recommendation of the attorney general of the united states president donald j. trump directed the intelligence community to quickly and fully cooperate with the attorney general’s investigation into surveillance activities........during the 2016 presidential election. the attorney general has also been delegated full and complete authority to declassify information pertaining to this investigation in accordance with the long-established standards for handling classified information........today’s action will help ensure that all americans learn the truth about the events that occurred and the actions that were taken during the last presidential election and will restore confidence in our public institutions.” @presssec“nancy pelosi should not be out there doing the kinds of things she is doing. she will diminish herself and her membership. she cannot put a subject with a predicate in the same sentence. what’s going on?”  ed rollins  @greggjarrett  @loudobbs71% of voters rate the economy as excellent or good. the highest number in more than 18 years! @quinnipiacpollwow! cnn ratings are way down record lows. people are getting tired of so many fake stories and anti-trump lies. chris cuomo was rewarded for lowest morning ratings with a prime time spot - which is failing badly and not helping the dumbest man on television don lemon!when is twitter going to allow the very popular conservative voices that it has so viciously shut down back into the open? it is time!“intelligence agencies were used against an american president.” @devinnunes  @shannonbream @foxnews  this should never happen to a president again! dems are furious at robert mueller for his findings - no collusion no obstruction. now they should go back to work and legislate!“if they try to impeach president trump who has done nothing wrong (no collusion) they will end up getting him re-elected” @lindseygrahamsc impeachment is for high crimes and misdemeanors. there were no high crimes and misdemeanors except for those committed by the other side!i don’t know why the radical left democrats want bob mueller to testify when he just issued a 40 million dollar report that states loud  clear  for all to hear no collusion and no obstruction (how do you obstruct a no crime?) dems are just looking for trouble and a do-over!congratulations to tom cotton - his book “sacred duty: a solider’s tour at arlington national cemetery” just hit the best sellers list. i was at @arlingtonnatl yesterday  the people there were so grateful for tom’s inspiring portrait of “the old guard.” great job @tomcottonar!just spoke to prime minister @narendramodi where i congratulated him on his big political victory. he is a great man and leader for the people of india - they are lucky to have him!i am

judges........(with many more to come) and 2 supreme court justices - we are getting into record territory! thank you all and have a great memorial day weekend......the dems want a second shot at bob mueller are very unhappy with the no collusion report. they should not be allowed to play this game any longer - no second chances - must get back to work. so bad for our country!democrat senator mark warner is acting and talking like he is in total control of the senate intelligence committee. their is nothing bipartisan about him. he should not be allowed to take “command” of that committee. too important! remember when he spoke to the russian jokester?can’t believe that rolling thunder would be given a hard time with permits in washington d.c. they are great patriots who i have gotten to know and see in action. they love our country and love our flag. if i can help i will!getting ready to land in japan with first lady melania. we look forward to seeing everyone soon!🇺🇸🇯🇵another activist obama appointed judge has just ruled against us on a section of the southern wall that is already under construction. this is a ruling against border security and in favor of crime drugs and human trafficking. we are asking for an expedited appeal!in addition to great incompetence and corruption the smollett case in chicago is also about a hate crime. remember “maga country did it!” that turned out to be a total lie had nothing to do with “maga country.” serious stuff and not even an apology to millions of people!north korea fired off some small weapons which disturbed some of my people and others but not me. i have confidence that chairman kim will keep his promise to me  also smiled when he called swampman joe  bidan a low iq individual  worse. perhaps that’s sending me a signal?going to play golf right now with @abeshinzo. japan loves the game. tremendous fans of @jacknicklaus @tigerwoods and @philmickelson — i said what about @garyplayer they said we love gary too!north korea fired off some small weapons which disturbed some of my people and others but not me. i have confidence that chairman kim will keep his promise to me  also smiled when he called swampman joe biden a low iq individual  worse. perhaps that’s sending me a signal?great fun and meeting with prime minister @abeshinzo. numerous japanese officials told me that the democrats would rather see the united states fail than see me or the republican party succeed - death wish!great progress being made in our trade negotiations with japan. agriculture and beef heavily in play. much will wait until after their july elections where i anticipate big numbers!“why doesn’t the press apologize to president trump for the russian collusion delusion?” @marklevinshow  @judgejeanine  how about the dems also?the great patriots of rolling thunder will be coming back to washington d.c. next year  hopefully for many years to come. it is where they want to be  where they should be. have a wonderful time today. thank you to our great men  women of the pentagon for working it out!the dems are getting nothing done in congress! they only want a do-over on mueller!hoping things will work out with israel\\'s coalition formation and bibi and i can continue to make the alliance between america and israel stronger than ever. a lot more to do!....super predator was the term associated with the 1994 crime bill that sleepy joe biden was so heavily involved in passing. that was a dark period in american history but has sleepy joe apologized? no!anyone associated with the 1994 crime bill will not have a chance of being elected. in particular african americans will not be able to vote for you. i on the other hand was responsible for criminal justice reform which had tremendous support  helped fix the bad 1994 bill!i will be making two stops this morning in japan to visit with our great military then a quick stop in alaska and back to d.c. meetings with prime minister abe went very well and getting to spend time with the new emperor and empress of japan was a great honor!spoke with @govstitt of oklahoma last night from japan because of the devastating tornadoes. told him that @fema and the federal government are fully behind him and the great people of oklahoma.storms overnight across ohio and many other states were very dangerous and damaging. my team continues to update me with reports from emergency managers in the states affected. listen to your local officials and be resilient. we are with you!just spoke to governor @asahutchinson of the great state of arkansas to inform him that fema and the federal government will do whatever is necessary to help out with what has turned out to be record flooding. asa and local officials are doing a great job!i was actually sticking up for sleepy joe biden while on foreign soil. kim jong un called him a “low iq idiot” and many other things whereas i related the quote of chairman kim as a much softer “low iq individual.” who could possibly be upset with that?back from japan after a very successful trip. big progress on many fronts. a great country with a wonderful leader in prime minister abe!republicans cannot allow themselves to again lose the senate seat in the great state of alabama. this time it will be for six years not just two. i have nothing against roy moore and unlike many other republican leaders wanted him to win. but he didn’t and probably won’t........if alabama does not elect a republican to the senate in 2020 many of the incredible gains that we have made during my presidency may be lost including our pro-life victories. roy moore cannot win and the consequences will be devastating....judges and supreme court justices!nothing changes from the mueller report. there was insufficient evidence and therefore in our country a person is innocent. the case is closed! thank you.how do you impeach a republican president for a crime that was committed by the democrats? witch-hunt!great show tonight @seanhannity you really get it (9:00 p.m. @foxnews) that’s why you’re number one (by far)! also please tell mark levin congrats on having the number one book!i was not informed about anything having to do with the navy ship uss john s. mccain during my recent visit to japan. nevertheless @flotus and i loved being with our great military men and women - what a spectacular job they do!the greatest presidential harassment in history. after spending $40000000 over two dark years with unlimited access people resources and cooperation highly conflicted robert mueller would have brought charges if he had anything but there were no charges to bring!russia russia russia! that’s all you heard at the beginning of this witch hunt hoax...and now russia has disappeared because i had nothing to do with russia helping me to get elected. it was a crime that didn’t exist. so now the dems and their partner the fake news media.........say he fought back against this phony crime that didn’t exist this horrendous false acquisition and he shouldn’t fight back he should just sit back and take it. could this be obstruction? no mueller didn’t find obstruction either. presidential harassment!russia russia russia! that’s all you heard at the beginning of this witch hunt hoax...and now russia has disappeared because i had nothing to do with russia helping me to get elected. it was a crime that didn’t exist. so now the dems and their partner the fake news media.........say he fought back against this phony crime that didn’t exist this horrendous false accusation and he shouldn’t fight back he should just sit back and take it. could this be obstruction? no mueller didn’t find obstruction either. presidential harassment!congressman john ratcliffe “the trump campaign clearly did not conspire or collude.” @foxnews“comey and brennan are turning on each other.”  @kilmeaderobert mueller came to the oval office (along with other potential candidates) seeking to be named the director of the fbi. he had already been in that position for 12 years i told him no. the next day he was named special counsel - a total conflict of interest. nice!very sad to hear the news on the passing of my friend senator thad cochran. he was a real senator with incredible values - even flew back to senate from mississippi for important healthcare vote when he was desperately ill. thad never let our country (or me) down!just arrived in colorado. getting ready to deliver the commencement speech at the air force academy graduation. very exciting - probably will be broadcast live on tv. they want good ratings!the navy put out a disclaimer on the mccain story. looks like the story was an exaggeration or even fake news - but why not everything else is!on june 10th the united states will impose a 5% tariff on all goods coming into our country from mexico until such time as illegal migrants coming through mexico and into our country stop. the tariff will gradually increase

he speaks the truth!sean davis the federalist: “mueller proved his entire operation was a political hit job. still zero evidence of trump-russia collusion and no new evidence from mueller.”  @tuckercarlson @foxnewshard to believe that with the crisis on the border the dems won’t do the quick and easy fix. would solve the problem but they want open borders which equals crime!mexico has taken advantage of the united states for decades. because of the dems our immigration laws are bad. mexico makes a fortune from the u.s. have for decades they can easily fix this problem. time for them to finally do what must be done!in order not to pay tariffs if they start rising companies will leave mexico which has taken 30% of our auto industry and come back home to the usa. mexico must take back their country from the drug lords and cartels. the tariff is about stopping drugs as well as illegals!90% of the drugs coming into the united states come through mexico  our southern border. 80000 people died last year 1000000 people ruined. this has gone on for many years  nothing has been done about it. we have a 100 billion dollar trade deficit with mexico. it’s time!saddened to hear about the loss of john pinto a navajo code talker in world war ii over the memorial day weekend. the code talkers are true american heroes and john never stopped serving his fellow citizens as a longtime new mexico state senator. john rest in peace!.@seanhannity is having a deep state show tonight on fox news at 9:00 pm (e) exposing the tremendous abuse of power that has been uncovered.

done an outstanding job – no collusion - no obstruction! case closed! emmet is my friend and i thank him for the great job he has done.the united states stands ready to work with @nayibbukele to advance prosperity in el salvador and the hemisphere. congratulations president bukele on your inauguration!washington post got it wrong as usual. the u.s. is charging 25% against 250 billion dollars of goods shipped from china not 200 bd. also china is paying a heavy cost in that they will subsidize goods to keep them coming devalue their currency yet companies are moving to.........u.s. in order to avoid paying the 25% tariff. like mexican companies will move back to the united states once the tariff reaches the higher levels. they took many of our companies  jobs the foolish pols let it happen and now they will come back unless mexico stops the........travesty that is taking place in allowing millions of people to easily meander through their country and invade the u.s. not to mention the drugs  human trafficking pouring in through mexico. are the drug lords cartels  coyotes really running mexico? we will soon find out!when you are the “piggy bank” nation that foreign countries have been robbing and deceiving for years the word tariff is a beautiful word indeed! others must treat the united states fairly and with respect - we are no longer the “fools” of the past!the democrats are doing nothing on the border to address the humanitarian and national security crisis! could be fixed so easily if they would vote with republicans to fix the loopholes.people have been saying for years that we should talk to mexico. the problem is that mexico is an “abuser” of the united states taking but never giving. it has been this way for decades. either they stop the invasion of our country by drug dealers cartels human traffickers........coyotes and illegal immigrants which they can do very easily or our many companies and jobs that have been foolishly allowed to move south of the border will be brought back into the united states through taxation (tariffs). america has had enough!the wall is under construction and moving along quickly despite all of the radical liberal democrat lawsuits. what are they thinking as our country is invaded by so many people (illegals) and things (drugs) that we do not want. make america great again!no collusion no obstruction no nothing! “what the democrats are trying to do is the biggest sin in the impeachment business.” david rivkin constitutional scholar. meantime the dems are getting nothing done in congress. they are frozen stiff. get back to work much to do!i never called meghan markle “nasty.” made up by the fake news media and they got caught cold! will @cnn @nytimes and others apologize? doubt it!peggy noonan the simplistic writer for trump haters all is stuck in the past glory of reagan and has no idea what is happening with the radical left democrats or how vicious and desperate they are. mueller had to correct his ridiculous statement peggy never understood it!mexico is sending a big delegation to talk about the border. problem is they’ve been “talking” for 25 years. we want action not talk. they could solve the border crisis in one day if they so desired. otherwise our companies and jobs are coming back to the usa!democrats can’t impeach a republican president for crimes committed by democrats. the facts are “pouring” in. the greatest witch hunt in american history! congress go back to work and help us at the border with drug prices and on infrastructure.hearing word that russia syria and to a lesser extent iran are bombing the hell out of idlib province in syria and indiscriminately killing many innocent civilians. the world is watching this butchery. what is the purpose what will it get you? stop!kevin hassett who has done such a great job for me and the administration will be leaving shortly. his very talented replacement will be named as soon as i get back

not only have thousands of jobs been created in usa we’re shipping freedom and opportunity abroad!....kahn reminds me very much of our very dumb and incompetent mayor of nyc de blasio who has also done a terrible job - only half his height. in any event i look forward to being a great friend to the united kingdom and am looking very much forward to my visit. landing now!china is subsidizing its product in order that it can continue to be sold in the usa. many firms are leaving china for other countries including the united states in order to avoid paying the tariffs. no visible increase in costs or inflation but u.s. is taking billions!just arrived in the united kingdom. the only problem is that @cnn is the primary source of news available from the u.s. after watching it for a short while i turned it off. all negative  so much fake news very bad for u.s. big ratings drop. why doesn’t owner @att do something?i believe that if people stoped using or subscribing to @att they would be forced to make big changes at @cnn which is dying in the ratings anyway. it is so unfair with such bad fake news! why wouldn’t they act. when the world watches @cnn it gets a false picture of usa. sad!london part of trip is going really well. the queen and the entire royal family have been fantastic. the relationship with the united kingdom is very strong. tremendous crowds of well wishers and people that love our country. haven’t seen any protests yet but i’m sure the........fake news will be working hard to find them. great love all around. also big trade deal is possible once u.k. gets rid of the shackles. already starting to talk!russia has informed us that they have removed most of their people from venezuela.as a sign of good faith mexico should immediately stop the flow of people and drugs through their country and to our southern border. they can do it if they want!just had a big victory in federal court over the democrats in the house on the desperately needed border wall. a big step in the right direction. wall is under construction!can you imagine cryin’ chuck schumer saying out loud for all to hear that i am bluffing with respect to putting tariffs on mexico. what a creep. he would rather have our country fail with drugs  immigration than give republicans a win. but he gave mexico bad advice no bluff!washed up psycho @bettemidler was forced to apologize for a statement she attributed to me that turned out to be totally fabricated by her in order to make “your great president” look really bad. she got caught just like the fake news media gets caught. a sick scammer!plagiarism charge against sleepy joe biden on his ridiculous climate change plan is a big problem but the corrupt media will save him. his other problem is that he is drawing flies not people to his rallies. nobody is showing up i mean nobody. you can’t win without people!i kept hearing that there would be “massive” rallies against me in the uk but it was quite the opposite. the big crowds which the corrupt media hates to show were those that gathered in support of the usa and me. they were big  enthusiastic as opposed to the organized flops!if the totally corrupt media was less corrupt i would be up by 15 points in the polls based on our tremendous success with the economy maybe best ever! if the corrup media was actually fair i would be up by 25 points. nevertheless despite the fake news we’re doing great!.@flotus melania and i send our deepest condolences to president reuven rivlin and the entire state of israel upon the passing of mrs. nechama rivlin. mrs. rivlin represented her beloved country with grace and stature. we will miss her along with all those who knew her.could not have been treated more warmly in the united kingdom by the royal family or the people. our relationship has never been better and i see a very big trade deal down the road. “this trip has been an incredible success for the president.” @ingrahamanglehouse democrats fresh off a republican victory against them (in federal court) on the wall  keep asking people to come and testify regarding the no collusion witch hunt. they are very unhappy with the mueller report especially with his corrective letter  now want a do over!if the totally corrupt media was less corrupt i would be up by 15 points in the polls based on our tremendous success with the economy maybe best ever! if the corrupt media was actually fair i would be up by 25 points. nevertheless despite the fake news we’re doing great!“house republicans support the president on tariffs with mexico all the way  that makes any measure the president takes on the border totally veto proof. why wouldn’t you as republicans support him when that will allow our president to make a better deal.” thank you @gopleaderimmigration discussions at the white house with representatives of mexico have ended for the day. progress is being made but not nearly enough! border arrests for may are at 133000 because of mexico  the democrats in congress refusing to budge on immigration reform. further...“the president has received glowing reviews from the british media. here at home not so much. msnbc ramps up hateful coverage and promotes conspiracy theories during trump’s trip to europe.”  @seanhannity  the good news is that @maddow is dying in the ratings along with @cnn!a big and beautiful day today!so sorry to hear about the terrible accident involving our great west point cadets. we mourn the loss of life and pray for the injured. god bless them all!john solomon: factual errors and major omissions in the mueller report show that it is totally biased against trump.china is subsidizing its product in order that it can continue to be sold in the usa. many firms are leaving china for other

products at very high levels starting immediately. if we are unable to make the deal mexico will begin paying tariffs at the 5% level on monday!democrats are incapable of doing a good and solid immigration bill!for all of the money we are spending nasa should not be talking about going to the moon - we did that 50 years ago. they should be focused on the much bigger things we are doing including mars (of which the moon is a part) defense and science!heading back to d.c. many great things are happening for our country!i am pleased to inform you that the united states of america has reached a signed agreement with mexico. the tariffs scheduled to be implemented by the u.s. on monday against mexico are hereby indefinitely suspended. mexico in turn has agreed to take strong

deal because mexico will be using their strong immigration laws - a game changer. people no longer will be released into the u.s.” also 6000 mexican troops at their southern border. currently there are few!mexico will try very hard and if they do that this will be a very successful agreement for both the united states and mexico!nervous nancy pelosi  the democrat house are getting nothing done. perhaps they could lead the way with the usmca the spectacular  very popular new trade deal that replaces nafta the worst trade deal in the history of the u.s.a. great for our farmers manufacturers  unions!everyone very excited about the new deal with mexico!i would like to thank the president of mexico andres manuel lopez obrador and his foreign minister marcelo ebrard together with all of the many representatives of both the united states and mexico for working so long and hard to get our agreement on immigration completed!watched msnbc this morning just to see what the opposition was saying about events of the past week. such lies almost everything they were saying was the opposite of the truth. fake news! no wonder their ratings along with cnn are way down. the hatred comcast has is amazing!just watched the great @rick24barry basketball hall of famer on the @marklevinshow @foxnews. a wonderful interview of a very smart and interesting guy by the man mark levin who has the number one bestselling book unfreedom of the press. two winners!....other than to know he was and is a total loser. when he makes statements about me they are made up he knows nothing!i know it is not at all “presidential” to hit back at the corrupt media or people who work for the corrupt media when they make false statements about me or the trump administration. problem is if you don’t hit back people believe the fake news is true. so we’ll hit back!another false report in the failing  @nytimes. we have been trying to get some of these border actions for a long time as have other administrations but were not able to get them or get them in full until our signed agreement with mexico. additionally and for many years.........mexico was not being cooperative on the border in things we had or didn’t have and now i have full confidence especially after speaking to their president yesterday that they will be very cooperative and want to get the job properly done. importantly some things..........not mentioned in yesterday press release one in particular were agreed upon. that will be announced at the appropriate time. there is now going to be great cooperation between mexico  the usa something that didn’t exist for decades. however if for some unknown reason........there is not we can always go back to our previous very profitable position of tariffs - but i don’t believe that will be necessary. the failing @nytimes  ratings challenged @cnn will do anything possible to see our country fail! they are truly the enemy of the people!twitter should let the banned conservative voices back onto their platform without restriction. it’s called freedom of speech remember. you are making a giant mistake!if president obama made the deals that i have made both at the border and for the economy the corrupt media would be hailing them as incredible  a national holiday would be immediately declared. with me despite our record setting economy and all that i have done no credit!for two years all the democrats talked about was the mueller report because they knew that it was loaded up with 13 angry democrat trump haters later increased to 18. but despite the bias when the report came out the findings were no collusion and facts that led to............no obstruction. the dems were devastated - after all this time and money spent ($40000000) the mueller report was a disaster for them. but they want a redo or do over. they are even bringing in @cnn sleazebag attorney john dean. sorry no do overs - go back to work!the failing @nytimes story on mexico and illegal immigration through our southern border has now been proven shockingly false and untrue bad reporting and the paper is embarrassed by it. the only problem is that they knew it was fake news before it went out. corrupt media!now with our new deal mexico is doing more for the usa on illegal immigration than the democrats. in fact the democrats are doing nothing they want open borderswhich means illigal immigration drugs and crime.we have fully signed and documented another very important part of the immigration and security deal with mexico one that the u.s. has been asking about getting for many years. it will be revealed in the not too distant future and will need a vote by mexico’s legislative body!......we do not anticipate a problem with the vote but if for any reason the approval is not forthcoming tariffs will be reinstated!when will the failing new york times admit that their front page story on the  the new mexico deal at the border is a fraud and nothing more than a badly reported “hit job” on me something that has been going on since the first day i announced for the presidency! sick journalismcan’t believe they are bringing in john dean the disgraced nixon white house counsel who is a paid cnn contributor. no collusion - no obstruction! democrats just want a do-over which they’ll never get!i have been briefed on the helicopter crash in new york city. phenomenal job by our great first responders who are currently on the scene. thank you for all you do 24/7/365! the trump administration stands ready should you need anything at all.new book just out “the real deal my decade fighting battles and winning wars with trump” is really wonderful. it is written by two people who are very smart  know me well george sorial  damian bates as opposed to all the books where the author has no clue who i am. enjoy!“jerry nadler’s trump bashing show is a bust.” headline new york post. @foxandfriends  the greatest witch hunt of all time continues. all crimes were by the other side but the committee refuses to even take a look. deleting 33000 emails is the real obstruction - and much more!“mueller has spoken. he found no collusion between the trump campaign and the russians. the bottom line is what the democrat house is doing is trying to destroy the trump presidency (which has been a tremendous success) and i can assure you that we’re done with the mueller..........investigation in the senate. they can talk to john dean until the cows come home we’re not doing anything in the senate regarding the mueller report. we are going to harden our infrastructure against 2020!” @lindseygrahamscpresidential harassment!sad when you think about it but mexico right now is doing more for the united states at the border than the democrats in congress! @foxandfriendsthe united states has very low inflation a beautiful thing!maria dagan steve stuart v - when you are the big “piggy bank” that other countries have been ripping off for years (to a level that is not to be believed) tariffs are a great negotiating tool a great revenue producers and  most importantly a powerful way to get.........companies to come to the u.s.a and to get companies that have left us for other lands to come back home. we stupidly lost 30% of our auto business to mexico. if the tariffs went on at the higher level they would all come back and pass. but very happy with the deal i made.......if mexico produces (which i think they will). biggest part of deal with mexico has not yet been revealed! china is similar except they devalue currency and subsidize companies to lessen effect of 25% tariff. so far little effect to consumer. companies will relocate to u.s.good day in the stock market. people have no idea the tremendous potential our country has for growth - and many other things!“why did the democrats run if they didn’t want to do things?” @senrickscotton my way to iowa - just heard nearly 1000 agriculture groups signed a letter urging congress to

russia anymore since the issuance of the mueller report) house committee now plays the seldom used “contempt” card on our great a.g.  sec. of commerce - this time on the census. dems play a..........much tougher game than the republicans did when they had the house majority. republicans will remember! “this has already been argued before the u.s. supreme court but the house doesn’t want to wait. this is a common thread between all of the committees - do whatever you.......can to embarrass the trump administration (and republicans) attack the trump administration. this is campaigning by the dems.” attorney david bruno. so true! in the meantime they are getting no work done on drug pricing infrastructure  many other things.“congress cannot impeach president trump (did nothing wrong) because if they did they would be putting themselves above the law. the constitution provides criteria for impeachment - treason bribery high crimes   misdemeanors. unless there is compelling evidence impeachment.......is not constitutionally permissable.” alan dershowitz constitutional lawyerthe dems fight us at every turn - in the meantime they are accomplishing nothing for

and is called “president trump: 30 hours” (which is somewhat........misleading in that i personally spent only a small fraction of that time doing interviews. i do have a few other things to do you know!). think i will do many more network interviews as i did in 2016 in order to get the word out that no president has done what i have in........the first 2 1/2 years of his presidency including

great paper so desperate for a story any story even if bad for our country..........also not true! anything goes with our corrupt news media today. they will do or say whatever it takes with not even the slightest thought of consequence! these are true cowards and without doubt the enemy of the people!florida governor ron desantis just signed bill banning sanctuary cities in state  forcing all law enforcement agencies to cooperate with federal immigration authorities. bill prohibits local gov’t from enacting sanctuary policies that protect undocumented immigrants...@foxnews....more and more states want to do this but their governors and leaders don’t have the courage to do so. the politics will soon mandate however because people from california  all over the land are demanding that sanctuary cities be gone. no illegals drugs or trafficking!yesterday was the radical left democrats big impeachment day. they worked so hard to make it something really big and special but had one problem - almost nobody showed up. “the media admits low turnout for anti-trump rallies.” @foxnews  “all around the country people are............saying enough. democrat voters want to hear the politicians talking about issues. this is a huge distraction and will only help donald trump get elected.” @jedediahbila  “greatest president since ronald reagan” said a counter-protester. lehighvalleylivea poll should be done on which is the more dishonest and deceitful newspaper the failing new york times or the amazon (lobbyist) washington post! they are both a disgrace to our

if they are ok with the hiring of christopher steele a foreign agent paid for by crooked hillary and the dnc to dig up “dirt” and write a phony dossier against the presidential candidate of the opposing party...............if republicans ever did that to the democrats there would be all hell to pay. it would be a scandal like no other!almost 70% in new poll say don’t impeach. so ridiculous

department said it has identified 30 security incidents involving current or former employees and their handling of crooked hillary clinton’s emails. @foxnews  this is really big. never admitted before. highly classified material. will the dems investigate this?only a few people showed up for the so-called impeachment rallies over the weekend. the numbers were anemic no spirit no hope. more importantly no collusion no obstruction!mario draghi just announced more stimulus could come which immediately dropped the euro against the dollar making it unfairly easier for them to compete against

back hope hicks. why aren’t the dems looking at the.........33000 emails that hillary and her lawyer deleted and acid washed after getting a subpoena from congress? that is real obstruction that the dems want no part of because their hearings are rigged and a disgrace to our country!democrat congressional hearings are #rigged!if i didn’t have the phony witch hunt going on for 3 years and if the fake news media and their partner in crime the democrats would have played it straight i would be way up in the polls right now - with our economy winning by 20 points. but i’m winning anyway!so sad that the democrats are putting wonderful hope hicks through hell for 3 years now after total exoneration by robert mueller  the mueller report. they were unhappy with result so they want a do over. very unfair  costly to her. will it ever end? why aren’t they...........asking hillary clinton why she deleted and acid washed her emails after getting a subpoena from congress? anybody else would be

perpetrated in part by people inside the government and in part by a compliant (fake news) media.” mollie hemingway.  @tuckercarlson @foxandfriends  the facts are starting to pour out. stay tuned!president obama made a desperate and terrible deal with iran - gave them 150 billion dollars plus i.8 billion dollars in cash! iran was in big trouble and he bailed them out. gave them a free path to nuclear weapons and soon. instead of saying thank you iran yelled.........death to america. i terminated deal which was not even ratified by congress and imposed strong sanctions. they are a much weakened nation today than at the beginning of my presidency when they were causing major problems throughout the middle east. now they are bust!........on monday they shot down an unmanned drone flying in international waters. we were cocked  loaded to retaliate last night on 3 different sights when i asked how many will die. 150 people sir was the answer from a general. 10 minutes before the strike i stopped it not........proportionate to shooting down an unmanned drone. i am in no hurry our military is rebuilt new  and ready to go by far the best in the world. sanctions are biting  more added last night. iran can never have nuclear weapons not against the usa and not against the world!the people that ice will apprehend have already been ordered to be deported. this means that they have run from the law and run from the courts. these are people that are supposed to go back to their home country. they broke the law by coming into the country  now by staying.when people come into our country illegally they will be deported!stock market is on track to have the best june in over 50 years! thank you mr. president! @wallstreetjouri am at camp david working on many things including

market best june in 50 years!iran cannot have nuclear weapons! under the terrible obama plan they would have been on their way to nuclear in a short number of years and existing verification is not acceptable. we are putting major additional sanctions on iran on monday. i look forward to the day that.........sanctions come off iran and they become a productive and prosperous nation again - the sooner the better!at the request of democrats i have delayed the illegal immigration removal process (deportation) for two weeks to see if the democrats and republicans can get together and work out a solution to the asylum and loophole problems at the southern border. if not deportations start!i never called the strike against iran “back” as people are incorrectly reporting i just stopped it from going forward at this time!i want to give the democrats every last chance to quickly negotiate simple changes to asylum and loopholes. this will fix the southern border together with the help that mexico is now giving us. probably won’t happen but worth a try. two weeks and big deportation begins!when our country had no debt and built everything from highways to the military with cash we had a big system of tariffs. now we allow other countries to steal our wealth treasure and jobs - but no more! the usa is doing great with unlimited upside into the future!china gets 91% of its oil from the straight japan 62%  many other countries likewise. so why are we protecting the shipping lanes for other countries (many years) for zero compensation. all of these countries should be protecting their own ships on what has always been........a dangerous journey. we don’t even need to be there in that the u.s. has just become (by far) the largest producer of energy anywhere in the world! the u.s. request for iran is very simple - no nuclear weapons and no further sponsoring of terror!despite a federal reserve that doesn’t know what it is doing - raised rates far to fast (very low inflation other parts of world slowing lowering  easing)  did large scale tightening $50 billion/month we are on course to have one of the best months of june in u.s. history......think of what it could have been if the fed had gotten it right. thousands of points higher on the dow and gdp in the 4’s or even 5’s. now they stick like a stubborn child when we need rates cuts  easing to make up for what other countries are doing against us. blew it!despite a federal reserve that doesn’t know what it is doing - raised rates far too fast (very low inflation other parts of world slowing lowering

blew it!stock market is heading for one of the best months (june) in the history of our country. thank you mr. president!iran leadership doesn’t understand the words “nice” or “compassion” they never have. sadly the thing they do understand is strength and power and the usa is by far the most powerful military force in the world with 1.5 trillion dollars invested over the last two years alone......the wonderful iranian people are suffering and for no reason at all. their leadership spends all of its money on terror and little on anything else. the u.s. has not forgotten iran’s use of ied’s  efp’s (bombs) which killed 2000 americans and wounded many more.......iran’s very ignorant and insulting statement put out today only shows that they do not understand reality. any attack by iran on anything american will be met with great and overwhelming force. in some areas overwhelming will mean obliteration. no more john kerry  obama!a brave former fighter jet pilot and warrior

fights hard against illegal immigration. he loves our military our vets and our great second amendment. i give thom my full and total endorsement!presidential harassment!too bad the dems in congress won’t do anything at all about border security. they want open borders which means crime. but we are getting it done including building the wall! more people than ever before are coming because the usa economy is so good the best in history.i will be interviewed by @mariabartiromo today at 8:15 a.m. on @foxbusiness. enjoy!democrats want open borders which equals violent crime drugs and human trafficking. they also want very high taxes like 90%. republicans want what’s good for america - the exact opposite!women’s soccer player @meganrapino just stated that she is “not going to the f...ing white house if we win.” other than the nba which now refuses to call owners owners (please explain that i just got criminal justice reform passed black unemployment is at the lowest level.......in our country’s history and the poverty index is also best number ever) leagues and teams love coming to the white house. i am a big fan of the american team and women’s soccer but megan should win first before she talks! finish the job! we haven’t yet........invited megan or the team but i am now inviting the team win or lose. megan should never disrespect our country the white house or our flag

especially since so much has been done for her  the team. be proud of the flag that you wear. the usa is doing great!the democrats should change the loopholes and asylum laws so lives will be saved at our southern border. they said it was not a crisis at the border that it was all just “manufactured.” now they admit that i was right - but they must do something about it. fix the laws now!the democrats would save many lives if they would change our broken and very dangerous immigration laws. it can be done instantly!“i have been in office for many years the military is very important to me and at no time in my professional life has the u.s. military been as strong as it is right now.” thank you @lindseygrahamscaccording to fake news (and low ratings) @cnn “democrats say hearings could change impeachment debate.” that’s because they have lost the impeachment debate (80% say no) and they are hoping that yet another do over after 2 1/2 years and $40000000 will turn things around........no collusion no obstruction! robert mueller said he was done after his last 9 minute news conference as later corrected. now the dems want to  give it another try. does it ever end?the republican senate just passed bipartisan humanitarian assistance for our southern border 84-8! in addition to aid congress must close the catastrophic loopholes that are driving the crisis. we must end incentives for smuggling children trafficking women and selling drugs.why aren’t the democrats in the house calling comey brennan clapper page and her fbi lover (whose invaluable phone records were illegally deleted) crooked hillary podesta ohr (and nellie) the gps fusion characters christopher steele the dnc ( their missing server)........and all of the others who have leaked lied and did

many but especially the african american community democrats have tried and failed to pass criminal justice reform.......they came to me asking for help and i got criminal justice reform passed with help from both republicans and democrats. many said that nobody but president trump could have done this. all previous administrations failed. please ask why they failed to the candidates!boring!.@nbcnews and @msnbc should be ashamed of themselves for having such a horrible technical breakdown in the middle of the debate. truly unprofessional and only worthy of a fake news organization which they are!i look forward to speaking with prime minister modi about the fact that india for years having put very high tariffs against the united states just recently increased the tariffs even further. this is unacceptable and the tariffs must be withdrawn!seems totally ridiculous that our government and indeed country cannot ask a basic question of citizenship in a very expensive detailed and important census in this case for 2020. i have asked the lawyers if they can delay the census no matter how long until the.....bipartisan humanitarian aid bill for the southern border just passed. a great job done by all! now we must work to get rid of the loopholes and fix asylum. thank you also to mexico for the work being done on helping with illegal immigration - a very big difference!all democrats just raised their hands for giving millions of illegal aliens unlimited healthcare. how about taking care of american citizens first!? that’s the end of that race!the stock market went up massively from the day after i won the election all the way up to the day that i took office because of the enthusiasm for the fact that i was going to be president. that big stock market increase must be credited to me. if hillary won - a big crash!i am in japan at the g-20 representing our country well but i heard it was not a good day for sleepy joe or crazy bernie. one

chinese company huawei to buy product from them which will not impact our  national security. importantly we have opened up negotiations........again with china as our relationship with them continues to be a very good one. the quality of the transaction is far more important to me than speed. i am in no hurry but things look very good! their will be no reduction in the tariffs currently being charged to china.i am in south korea now. president moon and i have “toasted” our new trade deal a far better one for us than that which it replaced. today i will visit with and speak to our troops -

unlimited potential looking into the future!leaving south korea after a wonderful meeting with chairman kim jong un. stood on the soil of north korea an important statement for all and a great honor!so many amazing things happened over the last three days. all or at least most of those things are great for the united states. much was accomplished!“stock had the best first half since 1997.” @wallstreetjour  our country is doing great - the talk of the world!“stocks cap best first half since 1997” @wallstreetjour  our country is doing great!“stocks cap best first half since 1997” @wsj our country is doing great!congratulations to legislators in new jersey for not passing taxes that would have driven large numbers of high end taxpayers out of the state. many were planning to leave  will now be staying. new york  others should start changing their thought process on taxes fast!thank you to president moon of south korea for hosting the american delegation and me immediately following the very successful g-20 in japan. while there it was great to call on chairman kim of north korea to have our very well covered meeting. good things can happen for all!congratulations to prime minister abe of japan for hosting such a fantastic and well run g-20. there wasn’t a thing that was missing or a mistake that was made. perfect! the people of japan must be very proud of their prime minister.“in my opinion the president has done more good on the korean issue in the last year and a half than president obama did in eight years. if you look at the strides they made during the obama years which advocated strategic patience-they stuck their head in the sand. this is..........why president trump has to deal with north korea the way it is now. he had to figure out what to do with the korea mess. i think this is why the president deserves a lot of credit.” harry kazianis center for the national interest. thank you!it is very hard and expensive to live in new york. governor andrew cuomo uses his attorney general as a bludgeoning tool for his own purposes. they sue on everything always in search of a crime. i even got sued on a foundation which took zero rent  expenses  gave away.......more money than it had. going on for years originally brought by crooked hillary’s campaign chair a.g. eric schneiderman until forced to resign for abuse against women. they never even looked at the disgusting clinton foundation. now cuomo’s a.g. is harassing all of my........new york businesses in search of anything at all they can find to make me look as bad as possible. so on top of ridiculously high taxes my children and companies are spending a fortune on lawyers. no wonder people and businesses are fleeing new york in record numbers!that’s right the trump foundation gave away 100% plus with zero rent or expenses charged and has been being sued by cuomo and new york state for years - another part of the political witch hunt. just in case anyone is interested - clinton foundation never even looked at!i am excited to announce that @mercedesschlapp will soon be joining our campaign. she feels so strongly about our country  its future. we are setting records in so many ways  we will keep it going. mercedes has done a fantastic job within the administration  i am so thankful!it was great being with chairman kim jong un of north korea this weekend. we had a great meeting he looked really well and very healthy - i look forward to seeing him again soon........in the meantime our teams will be meeting to work on some solutions to very long term and persistent problems. no rush but i am sure we will ultimately get there!people are fleeing new york like never before. if they own a business they are twice as likely to flee. and if they are a victim of harassment by the a.g. of the state like what they are doing to our great nra which i think will move quickly to texas where they are loved........texas will defend them  indemnify them against political harassment by new york state and governor cuomo. so many people are leaving new york for texas and florida that it is totally under siege. first new york taxes you too high then they sue you just to complete the jobmark levin has written a big number one bestselling book called conspicuously and accurately “unfreedom of the press.” it is a great book that tells it like it is fake news and all. keep this book number one!as most people are aware according to the polls i won every debate including the three with crooked hillary clinton despite the fact that in the first debate they modulated the sound on me and got caught. this crew looks somewhat easier than crooked but you never know?the economy is the best it has ever been! even much of the fake news is giving me credit for that!big 4th of july in d.c. “salute to america.” the pentagon  our great military leaders are thrilled to be doing this  showing to the american people among other things the strongest and most advanced military anywhere in the world. incredible flyovers  biggest ever fireworks!robert mueller is being asked to testify yet again. he said he could only stick to the report  that is what he would and must do. after so much testimony  total transparency this witch hunt must now end. no more do overs. no collusion no obstruction. the great hoax is dead!i am pleased to announce that it is my intention to nominate christopher waller ph. d. executive vp and director of research federal reserve bank of st. louis missouri to be on the board of the federal reserve........prior to his current position christopher served as a professor and chair of economics at notre dame.i am pleased to announce that it is my intention to nominate judy shelton ph. d. u.s. executive dir european bank of reconstruction  development. judy is a founding member of the board of directors of empower america and has served on the board of directors of hilton hotels.i am pleased to announce that it is my intention to nominate judy shelton ph. d. u.s. executive dir european bank of reconstruction  development to be on the board of the federal reserve........judy is a founding member of the board of directors of empower america and has served on the board of directors of hilton hotels.a very sad time for america when the supreme court of the united states won’t allow a question of “is this person a citizen of the united states?” to be asked on the #2020 census! going on for a long time. i have asked the department of commerce and the department of justice........to do whatever is necessary to bring this most vital of questions and this very important case to a successful conclusion. usa! usa! usa!iran was violating the 150 billion dollar (plus 1.8 billion dollar in cash) nuclear deal with the united states and others who paid nothing long before i became president - and they have now breached their stockpile limit. not good!our july 4th salute to america at the lincoln memorial is looking to be really big. it will be the show of a lifetime!we have the greatest economy anywhere in the world. we have the greatest military anywhere in the world. not bad!sp 500 hits new record high. up 19% for the year. congratulations!china and europe playing big currency manipulation game and pumping money into their system in order to compete with usa. we should match or continue being the dummies who sit back and politely watch as other countries continue to play their games - as they have for many years!the cost of our great salute to america tomorrow will be very little compared to what it is worth. we own the planes we have the pilots the airport is right next door (andrews) all we need is the fuel. we own the tanks and all. fireworks are donated by two of the greats. nice!congratulations to navy seal eddie gallagher his wonderful wife andrea and his entire family. you have been through much together. glad i could help!the news reports about the department of commerce dropping its quest to put the citizenship question on the census is incorrect or to state it differently fake! we are absolutely moving forward as we must because of the importance of the answer to this question.our border patrol people are not hospital workers doctors or nurses. the democrats bad immigration laws which could be easily fixed are the problem. great job by border patrol above and beyond. many of these illegals aliens are living far better now than where they..........came from and in far safer conditions. no matter how good things actually look even if perfect the democrat visitors will act shocked  aghast at how terrible things are. just pols. if they really want to fix them change the immigration laws and loopholes. so easy to do!.....now if you really want to fix the crisis at the southern border both humanitarian and otherwise tell migrants not to come into our country unless they are willing to do so legally and hopefully through a system based on merit. this way we have no problems at all!if illegal immigrants are unhappy with the conditions in the quickly built or refitted detentions centers just tell them not to come. all problems solved!mexico is doing a far better job than the democrats on the border. thank you mexico!iran has just issued a new warning. rouhani says that they will enrich uranium to “any amount we want” if there is no new nuclear deal. be careful with the threats iran. they can come back to bite you like nobody has been bitten before!today’s stock market is the highest in the history of our great country! this is the 104th time since the election of 2016 that we have reached a new high. congratulations usa!so important for our country that the very simple and basic “are you a citizen of the united states?” question be allowed to be asked in the 2020 census. department of commerce and the department of justice are working very hard on this even on the 4th of july!happy 4th of july!people are coming from far and wide to join us today and tonight for what is turning out to be one of the biggest celebrations in the history of our country salute to america an all day event at the lincoln memorial culminating with large scale flyovers of the most modern.........and advanced aircraft anywhere in the world. perhaps even aircraft one will do a low  loud sprint over the crowd. that will start at 6:00p.m. but be there early. then at 9:00 p.m. a great (to put it mildly) fireworks display. i will speak on behalf of our great country!people are coming from far and wide to join us today and tonight for what is turning out to be one of the biggest celebrations in the history of our country salute to america an all day event at the lincoln memorial culminating with large scale flyovers of the most modern.........and advanced aircraft anywhere in the world. perhaps even air force one will do a low  loud sprint over the crowd. that will start at 6:00p.m. but be there early. then at 9:00 p.m. a great (to put it mildly) fireworks display. i will speak on behalf of our great country!great news for the republican party as one of the dumbest  most disloyal men in congress is “quitting” the party. no collusion no obstruction! knew he couldn’t get the nomination to run again in the great state of michigan. already being challenged for his seat. a total loser!been fully briefed on earthquake in southern california. all seems to be very much under control!weather looking good clearing rapidly and temperatures going down fast. see you in 45 minutes 6:30 to 7:00 p.m. at lincoln memorial!my deepest sympathies go out to the family and friends of great businessman and energy expert chris cline his wonderful daughter kameron and their friends on the tragic accident which took place in the bahamas. the great people of west virginia will never forget them!strong jobs report low inflation and other countries around the world doing anything possible to take advantage of the united states knowing that our federal reserve doesn’t have a clue! they raised rates too soon too often  tightened while others did just the opposite........as well as we are doing from the day after the great election when the market shot right up it could have been even better - massive additional wealth would have been created  used very well. our most difficult problem is not our competitors it is the federal reserve!joe biden is a reclamation project. some things are just not salvageable. china and other countries that ripped us off for years are begging for him. he deserted our military our law enforcement and our healthcare. added more debt than all other presidents combined. won’t win!sleepy joe biden just admitted he worked with segregationists and separately has already been very plain about the fact that he will be substantially raising everyone’s taxes if he becomes president. ridiculously all democrats want to substantially raise taxes!last year was the first in 51 years where prescription drug prices actually went down but things have been and are being put in place that will drive them down substantially. if dems would work with us in a bipartisan fashion we would get big results very fast!the fake news media in particular the failing @nytimes is writing phony and exaggerated accounts of the border detention centers. first of all people should not be entering our country illegally only for us to then have to care for them. we should be allowed to focus on .........united states citizens first. border patrol and others in law enforcement have been doing a great job. we said there was a crisis - the fake news  the dems said it was “manufactured.” now all agree we were right but they always knew that. they are crowded (which we.........brought up not them) because the dems won’t change the loopholes and asylum. big media con job!we are building the wall now but the reason the badly needed wall wasn’t approved in the republican controlled house and senate was that we had a very slim majority in the senate  needed 9 democrat votes. they were totally unwilling to give wall votes to us want open borders!watching @foxnews weekend anchors is worse than watching low ratings fake news @cnn or lyin’ brian williams (remember when he totally fabricated a war story trying to make himself into a hero  got fired. a very dishonest journalist!) and the crew of degenerate...........comcast (nbc/msnbc) trump haters who do whatever brian  steve tell them to do. like cnn nbc is also way down in the ratings. but @foxnews who failed in getting the very boring dem debates is now loading up with democrats  even using fake unsourced @nytimes as.......a “source” of information (ask the times what they paid for the boston globe  what they sold it for (lost 1.5 billion dollars) or their old headquarters building disaster or their unfunded liability? @foxnews is changing fast but they forgot the people who got them there!impossible to believe that @foxnews has hired @donnabrazile the person fired by @cnn (after they tried to hide the bad facts  failed) for giving crooked hillary clinton the questions to a debate something unimaginable. now she is all over fox including shep smith by far........their lowest rated show. watch the @foxnews weekend daytime anchors who are terrible go after her big time. that’s what they want - but it sure is not what the audience wants!i have been very critical about the way the u.k. and prime minister theresa may handled brexit. what a mess she and her representatives have created. i told her how it should be done but she decided to go another way. i do not know the ambassador but he is not liked or well........thought of within the u.s. we will no longer deal with him. the good news for the wonderful united kingdom is that they will soon have a new prime minister. while i thoroughly enjoyed the magnificent state visit last month it was the queen who i was most impressed with!spoke to @gopleader kevin mccarthy about the earthquakes in california and informed him that we will be working very closely on emergency funding. also spoke to governor @gavinnewsom - all working together!the wacky ambassador that the u.k. foisted upon the united states is not someone we are thrilled with a very stupid guy. he should speak to his country and prime minister may about their failed brexit negotiation and not be upset with my criticism of how badly it was......handled. i told @theresa_may how to do that deal but she went her own foolish way-was unable to get it done. a disaster! i don’t know the ambassador but have been told he is a pompous fool. tell him the usa now has the best economy  military  anywhere in the world by far...“i agree with the president the supreme court got it wrong. there should be a question about citizenship on the census. a.g. barr sees a pathway to add the citizenship question.”  steve doocy @foxandfriends  working hard on something that should be so easy. people are fed up!outrage is growing in the great state of minnesota where our patriots are now having to fight for the right to say the pledge of allegiance. i will be fighting with you! @foxandfriends“with president trump at the helm not only is america getting great again but he’s going to make our estuaries our rivers our water - everything better - the things he is doing and done are just helping america tremendously.” thank you to bruce hrobak @foxandfriendsfood stamp participation hits 10 year low. wow! @oannindia has long had a field day putting tariffs on american products. no longer acceptable!recent “strained” decisions by the united states supreme court some so simple as allowing the question “are you a citizen of the united states” on our very expensive census report or the even more strained decisions (2) allowing the world’s most expensive  pathetic..........healthcare (obamacare) to stay in place when it would have been replaced by something far better shows how incredibly important our upcoming 2020 election is. i have long heard that the appointment of supreme court justices is a president’s most important decision. so true!....why would kentucky ever think of giving up the most powerful position in congress the senate majority leader for a freshman senator with little power in what will hopefully be the minority party. we need mitch in the senate to keep america great!!....to your favorite president me! these people are vicious and totally crazed but remember there are far more great people (“deplorables”) in this country than bad. do to them what they do to you. fight for bernie marcus and home depot!more and more the radical left is using commerce to hurt their “enemy.” they put out the name of a store brand or company and ask their so-called followers not to do business there. they don’t care who gets hurt but also don’t understand that two can play that game!so now the obama appointed judge on the census case (are you a citizen of the united states?) won’t let the justice department use the lawyers  that it wants to use. could this be a first?“fbi’s christopher steele (fake) story falls apart: false intel  media contacts were flagged before fisa.” john solomon the hill. @seanhannity“our company has grown since trump has taken control of the white house  the presidency in the sense that we have better opportunities now to do what we’ve been wanting to do for quite some time and that is to create manufacturing jobs. i believe that president trump has.........done a great job of reducing crime in the african american community because more african americans are at work today. trump is not a racist he’s a businessman. because he’s a great businessman he’s pushing for lives to be better.” michael brown ceo hydromatic techiran has long been secretly “enriching” in total violation of the terrible 150 billion dollar deal made by john kerry and the obama administration. remember that deal was to expire in a short number of years. sanctions will soon be increased substantially!word just out that i won a big part of the deep state and democrat induced witch hunt. unanimous decision in my favor from the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit on the ridiculous emoluments case. i don’t make money but lose a fortune for the honor of.....congratulations to @drgregmurphy1 of north carolina (#nc03) on his great primary victory for the united states congress. greg is tough on crime borders and loves our second amendment our military and our vets. he has my complete and total endorsement!i was just informed by marillyn hewson ceo of lockheed martin of her decision to keep the sikorsky helicopter plant in coatesville pennsylvania open and humming! we are very proud of pennsylvania and the people who work there....the white house will be hosting a very big and very important social media summit today. would i have become president without social media? yes (probably)! at its conclusion we will all go to the beautiful rose garden for a news conference on the census and citizenship.a big subject today at the white house social media summit will be the tremendous dishonesty bias discrimination and suppression practiced by certain companies. we will not let them get away with it much longer. the fake news media will also be there but for a limited period......the fake news is not as important or as powerful as social media. they have lost tremendous credibility since that day in november 2016 that i came down the escalator with the person who was to become your future first lady. when i ultimately leave office in six..........years or maybe 10 or 14 (just kidding) they will quickly go out of business for lack of credibility or approval from the public. that’s why they will all be endorsing me at some point one way or the other. could you imagine having sleepy joe biden or @alfredeneuman99.....or a very nervous and skinny version of pocahontas (1000/24th) as your president rather than what you have now so great looking and smart a true stable genius! sorry to say that even social media would be driven out of business along with and finally the fake news media!the pledge of allegiance to our great country in st. louis park minnesota is under siege. that is why i am going to win the great state of minnesota in the 2020 election. people are sick and tired of this stupidity and disloyalty to our wonderful usa!“nearly one million more blacks and two million more hispanics are employed than when barrack obama left office and minorities account for more than half of all new jobs created during the trump presidency. unemployment among black women has hovered near 5% for the last six.........months the lowest since 1972.” the wall street journal editorial board a tale of two economies. @ingrahamanglerobert johnson b.e.t. “i give the president a lot of credit for moving the economy in a positive direction that’s benefiting a large number of americans. i think the tax cuts clearly helped stimulate the economy. overall if you look at the u.s. economy and you look at.........the number of people who are no longer looking for jobs but who are now seeing the opportunity for job growth you’ve got to give the president an a plus for that.”  thank you robert one of our great business leaders!the fake news media loves the narrative that i didn’t use many banks because the banks didn’t like me. no i didn’t use many banks because i didn’t (don’t) need their money (old fashioned isn’t it?). if i did it would have been very easy for me to get.....and remember a bank that i did use years ago the now badly written about and maligned deutsche bank was then one of the largest and most prestigious banks in the world! they wanted my business and so did many others!democrats had to quickly take down a tweet called “kids in cages inhumane treatment at the border” because the horrible picture used was from the obama years. very embarrassing! @foxandfriendsnow the democrats have asked to see 12 more people who have already spent hours with robert mueller and spent a fortune on lawyers in so doing. how many bites at the apple do they get before working on border loopholes and asylum. they also want to interview the highly..........conflicted and compromised mueller again. he said he was “done” after his last 9 minute speech and that he had nothing more to say outside of the no collusion no obstruction report. enough already go back to work! i won unanimously the big emoluments case yesterday!“it seems that the brits and the french and the germans are coming around to the idea that the iranians are up to no good!” @billhemmer @foxnewsdow just hit 27000 for first time ever!so happy that i was able to keep sikorsky helicopter in the great state of pennsylvania. keep america great!a big subject today at the white house social media summit will be the tremendous dishonesty bias discrimination and suppression practiced by certain companies. we will not let them get away with it much longer. the fake news media will also be there but for a limited period.....the fake news is not as important or as powerful as social media. they have lost tremendous credibility since that day in november 2016 that i came down the

nervous and skinny version of pocahontas (1/1024th) as your president rather than what you have now so great looking and smart a true stable genius! sorry to say that even social media would be driven out of business along with and finally the fake news media!to everyone on the gulf coast: as you make preparations to protect your homes  loved ones from flooding  the coming storm it is imperative that you heed the directions of @fema state  local officials. we are working closely w/ them. please be prepared be careful  be safe!i am not a fan of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies which are not money and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air. unregulated crypto assets can facilitate unlawful behavior including drug trade and other illegal activity........similarly facebook libra’s “virtual currency” will have little standing or dependability. if facebook and other companies want to become a bank they must seek a new banking charter and become subject to all banking regulations just like other banks both national......and international. we have only one real currency in the usa and it is stronger than ever both dependable and reliable. it is by far the most dominant currency anywhere in the world and it will always stay that way. it is called the united states dollar!paul ryan the failed v.p. candidate  former speaker of the house whose record of achievement was atrocious (except during my first two years as president) ultimately became a long running lame duck failure leaving his party in the lurch both as a fundraiser  leader..........when mitt chose paul i told people that’s the end of that presidential run. he quit congress because he didn’t know how to win. they gave me standing o’s in the great state of wisconsin  booed him off the stage. he promised me the wall  failed (happening anyway!)..........he had the majority  blew it away with his poor leadership and bad timing. never knew how to go after the dems like they go after us. couldn’t get him out of congress fast enough!the great rush limbaugh will be on @foxandfriends at 8:30 a.m. enjoy!@sebgorka wins big no contest!when you are the big “piggy bank” that other countries have been ripping off for years (to a level that is not to be believed) tariffs are a great negotiating tool a great revenue producer and  most importantly a powerful way to get..........companies to come to the usa and to get companies that have left us for other lands to come back home. we  stupidly lost 30% of our auto business to mexico. if the tariffs went on at the higher level they would all come back and fast. but very happy with the deal i made........if mexico produces (which i think they will). biggest part of deal with mexico has not yet been revealed! china is similar except they devalue currency  subsidize companies to lessen effect of 25% tariffs. so far little effect to consumers. companies will relocate to u.s.wow @cnn ratings have crashed. lost all credibility!alex acosta informed me this morning that he felt the constant drumbeat of press about a prosecution which took place under his watch more than 12 years ago was bad for the administration which he so strongly believes in and he graciously tendered his resignation........alex was a great secretary of labor and his service is truly appreciated. he will be replaced on an acting basis by pat pizzella the current deputy secretary.we have a great team in pennsylvania! i’m proud to say that our good friends lawrence tabas  bernadette “bernie” comfort will now be working together to run the @pagop. lawrence will be chairman  bernie will chair my pennsylvania campaign. we must have  do great unity in pa!house minority leader kevin mccarthy is a far superior leader than was lame duck speaker paul ryan. tougher smarter and a far better fundraiser kevin is already closing in on 44 million dollars. paul’s final year numbers were according to breitbart “abysmal.” people like.........paul ryan almost killed the republican party. weak ineffective  stupid are not exactly the qualities that republicans or the citizens of our country were looking for. right now our spirit is at an all time high far better than the radical left dems. you’ll see next year!94% approval rating in the republican party an all time high. ronald reagan was 87%. thank you!a big risk of major flooding in large parts of louisiana and all across the gulf coast. please be very careful!so interesting to see “progressive” democrat congresswomen who originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe the worst most corrupt and inept anywhere in the world (if they even have a functioning government at all) now loudly..........and viciously telling the people of the united states the greatest and most powerful nation on earth how our government is to be run. why don’t they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came. then come back and show us how........it is done. these places need your help badly you can’t leave fast enough. i’m sure that nancy pelosi would be very happy to quickly work out free travel arrangements!friday’s tour showed vividly to politicians and the media how well run and clean the children’s detention centers are. great reviews! failing @nytimes story was fake! the adult single men areas were clean but crowded - also loaded up with a big percentage of criminals...........sorry can’t let them into our country. if too crowded tell them not to come to usa and tell the dems to fix the loopholes - problem solved!so sad to see the democrats sticking up for people who speak so badly of our country and who in addition hate israel with a true and unbridled passion. whenever confronted they call their adversaries including nancy pelosi “racist.” their disgusting language.........and the many terrible things they say about the united states must not be allowed to go unchallenged. if the democrat party wants to continue to condone such disgraceful behavior then we look even more forward to seeing you at the ballot box in 2020!we are doing great economically as a country number one despite the fed’s antiquated policy on rates and tightening. much room to grow!china’s 2nd quarter growth is the slowest it has been in more than 27 years. the united states tariffs are having a major effect on companies wanting to leave china for non-tariffed countries. thousands of companies are leaving. this is why china wants to make a deal........with the u.s. and wishes it had not broken the original deal in the first place. in the meantime we are receiving billions of dollars in tariffs from china with possibly much more to come. these tariffs are paid for by china devaluing  pumping not by the u.s. taxpayer!when will the radical left congresswomen apologize to our country the people of israel and even to the office of the president for the foul language they have used and the terrible things they have said. so many people are angry at them  their horrible  disgusting actions!if democrats want to unite around the foul language  racist hatred spewed from the mouths and actions of these very unpopular  unrepresentative congresswomen it will be interesting to see how it plays out. i can tell you that they have made israel feel abandoned by the u.s.“we all know that aoc and this crowd are a bunch of communists they hate israel they hate our own country they’re calling the guards along our border (the border patrol agents) concentration camp guards they accuse people who support israel as doing it for the benjamin’s........they are anti-semitic they are anti-america we don’t need to know anything about them personally talk about their policies. i think they are american citizens who are duly elected that are running on an agenda that is disgusting that the american people will reject..........what does it mean for america to have free healthcare for illegal immigrants no criminalization of coming into our country - see how that works for controlling immigration! they talk about israel like they’re a bunch of thugs not victims of the entire region. they wanted........to impeach president trump on day one. make them the face of the future of the democrat party you will destroy the democrat party. their policies will destroy our country!”  @lindseygrahamsc  need i say more?here we go with the fake polls. just like what happened with the election against crooked hillary clinton. abc nbc cnn @nytimes @washingtonpost they all got it wrong on purpose. suppression polls so early? they will never learn!we will never be a socialist or communist country. if you are not happy here you can leave! it is your choice and your choice alone. this is about love for america. certain people hate our country........they are anti-israel pro al-qaeda and comment on the 9/11 attack “some people did something.” radical left democrats want open borders which means drugs crime human trafficking and much more........detention facilities are not concentration camps! america has never been stronger than it is now – rebuilt military highest stock market ever lowest unemployment and more people working than ever before. keep america great!the dems were trying to distance themselves from the four “progressives” but now they are forced to embrace them. that means they are endorsing socialism hate of israel and the usa! not good for the democrats!the obama administration built the cages not the trump administration! democrats must give us the votes to change bad immigration laws.“the best economy in our lifetime!” @ingrahamanglethe democrat congresswomen have been spewing some of the most vile hateful and disgusting things ever said by a politician in the house or senate  yet they get a free pass and a big embrace from the democrat party. horrible anti-israel anti-usa pro-terrorist  public.....“billionaire tech investor peter thiel believes google should be investigated for treason. he accuses google of working with the chinese government.” @foxandfriends  a great and brilliant guy who knows this subject better than anyone! the trump administration will take a look!if you come after the president the country the flag - he’s going to defend himself. what the squad doesn’t like is that donald trump is enforcing the very laws that are on the books that were put there by congress.” jason chaffetz. also buy jason’s great new book power grab!our country is free beautiful and very successful. if you hate our country or if you are not happy here you can leave!those tweets were not racist. i don’t have a racist bone in my body! the so-called vote to be taken is a democrat con game. republicans should not show “weakness” and fall into their trap. this should be a vote on the filthy language statements and lies told by the democrat..........congresswomen who i

republican vote was 187-4. wow! also this was the first time since 1984 that the speaker of the house was ruled out of order and broke the rules of the house. quite a day!“in america if you hate our country you are free to leave. the simple fact of the matter is the four congresswomen think that america is wicked in its origins they think that america is even more wicked now that we are all racist and evil. they’re entitled to their........opinion they’re americans. now i’m entitled to my opinion  i just think they’re left wing cranks. they’re the reason there are directions on a shampoo bottle  we should ignore them. the “squad” has moved the democrat party substantially left and.........they are destroying the democrat party. i’m appalled that so many of our presidential candidates are falling all over themselves to try to agree with the four horsewomen of the apocalypse. i’m entitled to say that they’re wack jobs.”  louisiana senator john kennedythe democrats in congress are getting nothing done not on drug pricing not on immigration not on infrastructure not on nothing! sooo much opportunity yet all they want to do is go “fishing.” the american people are tired of the

attacks has been arrested in pakistan. great pressure has been exerted over the last two years to find him!the united states house of representatives has just overwhelmingly voted to kill the resolution on impeachment 332-95-1. this is perhaps the most ridiculous and time consuming project i have ever had to work on. impeachment of your president who has led the........greatest economic boom in the history of our country the best job numbers biggest tax reduction rebuilt military and much more is now over. this should never be allowed to happen to another president of the united states again!just returned to the white house from the great state of north carolina. what a crowd and what great people. the enthusiasm blows away our rivals on the radical left. #2020 will be a big year for the republican party!most of the ms-13 gang members indictedand  arrested in l.a. were illegal aliens 19 of 22. they are said to have killed many people in the most brutal fashion. they

lot of bad things are happening in puerto rico. the governor is under siege the mayor of san juan is a despicable and incompetent person who i wouldn’t trust under any circumstance and the united states congress foolishly gave 92 billion dollars for hurricane relief much........of which was squandered away or wasted never to be seen again. this is more than twice the amount given to texas  florida combined. i know the people of puerto rico well and they are great. but much of their leadership is corrupt  robbing the u.s. government blind!most of the ms-13 gang members indicted  arrested

weak and pathetic sort of guy writes columns for the new york times in between rounds of his favorite game golf. two weeks ago while speaking to a friend on his cell phone i unfortunately ended up speaking to friedman. we spoke for a while and.......he could not have been nicer or more respectful to your favorite president me. then i saw the column he wrote “trump will be re-elected won’t he?” he called me a racist which i am not and said rhode island went from economically bad to great in 5 years because the.........governor of the state did a good  job. that may be true but she could not have done it without the tremendous economic success of our country  the turnaround that my administration has caused. really nasty to me in his average i.q. columns kissed my a.. on the call. phony!because of the faulty thought process we have going for us at the federal reserve we pay much higher interest rates than countries that are no match for us economically. in other words our interest costs are much higher than other countries when they should be lower. correct!i like new york fed president john williams first statement much better than his second. his first statement is 100% correct in that the fed “raised” far too fast  too early. also must stop with the crazy quantitative tightening. we are in a world competition  winning big.......but it is no thanks to the federal reserve. had they not acted so fast and “so much” we would be doing even better than we are doing right now. this is our chance to build unparalleled wealth and success for the u.s. growth which would greatly reduce % debt. don’t blow it!....fed: there is almost no inflation!just spoke to @kanyewest about his friend a$ap rocky’s incarceration. i will be calling the very talented prime minister of sweden to see what we can do about helping a$ap rocky. so many people would like to see this quickly resolved!just had a very good call with @swedishpm stefan löfven who assured me that american citizen a$ap rocky will be treated fairly. likewise i assured him that a$ap was not a flight risk and offered to personally vouch for his bail or an alternative........our teams will be

watching please do what you have to do now!  @foxandfriendsthe great state of west virginia is producing record setting numbers and doing really well. when i became president it was practically shut down and closed for business. not anymore!big progress at the border but dems in congress must change the immigration laws for all to be good! end the loopholes and much more.the washington post story about my speech in north carolina and tweet with its phony sources who do not exist is fake news. the only thing people were talking about is the record setting crowd and the tremendous enthusiasm far greater than the democrats. you’ll see in 2020!presidential harassment!make america great again!i don’t believe the four congresswomen are capable of loving our country. they should apologize to america (and israel) for the horrible (hateful) things they have said. they are destroying the democrat party but are weak  insecure people who can never destroy our great nation!congratulations to bibi @netanyahu on becoming the longest serving pm in the history of israel. under your leadership israel has become a technology powerhouse and a world class economy........most importantly you have led israel with a commitment to the values of democracy freedom and equal opportunity that both our nations cherish and share!senator chuck schumer has finally gone to the southern border with some democrat senators. this is a great thing! nearby he missed a large group of illegal immigrants trying to enter the usa illegally. they wildly  rushed border patrol. some agents were badly injured........based on the comments made by senator schumer he must have seen how dangerous  bad for our country the border is. it is not a “manufactured crisis” as the fake news media  their democrat partners tried to portray. he said he wants to meet. i will set up a meeting asap!with almost no inflation our country is needlessly being forced to pay a much higher interest rate than other countries only because of a very misguided federal reserve. in addition quantitative tightening is continuing making it harder for our country to compete. as good.........as we have done it could have been soooo much better. interest rate costs should have been much lower  gdp  our country’s wealth accumulation much higher. such a waste of time  money. also very unfair that other countries manipulate their currencies and pump money in!it is far more costly for the federal reserve to cut deeper if the economy actually does in the future turn down! very inexpensive in fact productive  to move now. the fed raised  tightened far too much  too fast. in other words they missed it (big!). don’t miss it again!the amazon washington post front page story yesterday was total fake news. they said “advisors wrote new talking points and handed him reams of opposition research on the four congresswomen.” now really does that sound like me? what advisors there were no talking points........except for those stated by me  “reams of paper” were never given to me. it is a made up story meant to demean  belittle. the post had no sources. the facts remain the same that we have 4 radical left congresswomen who have said very bad things about israel  our country!the mainstream media is out of control. they constantly lie and cheat in order to get their radical left democrat views out their for all to see. it has never been this bad. they have gone bonkers  no longer care what is right or wrong. this large scale false reporting is sick!fake news equals the enemy of the people!highly conflicted robert mueller should not be given another bite at the apple. in the end it will be bad for him and the phony democrats in congress who have done nothing but waste time on this ridiculous witch hunt. result of the mueller report no collusion no obstruction!.......but the questions should be asked why were all of clinton’s people given immunity and why were the text messages of peter s and his lover lisa page deleted and destroyed right after they left mueller and after we requested them(this is illegal)?the report of iran capturing cia spies is totally false. zero truth. just more lies and propaganda (like their shot down drone) put out by a religious regime that is badly failing and has no idea what to do. their economy is dead and will get much worse. iran is a total mess!going with first lady to pay our respects to justice stevens. leaving now!the “squad” is a very racist group of troublemakers who are young inexperienced and not very smart. they are pulling the once great democrat party far left and were against humanitarian aid at the border...and are now against ice and homeland security. so bad for our country!i am pleased to announce that a deal has been struck with senate majority leader mitch mcconnell senate minority leader chuck schumer speaker of the house nancy pelosi and house minority leader kevin mccarthy - on a two-year budget and debt ceiling with no poison pills........this was a real compromise in order to give another big victory to our great military and vets!when we rip down and totally replace a badly broken and dilapidated barrier on the southern border something which cannot do the job the fake news media gives us zero credit for building a new wall. we have replaced many miles of old barrier with powerful new walls!“i completely read the entire mueller report and do you know what i concluded after reading both volume 1 and volume 2? there is no there there. no there there! we completely wasted everybody’s time and taxpayer’s money.” @trishregan“i completely read the entire mueller report and do you know what i concluded after reading both volume 1 and volume 2? there is no there there. no there there! we completely wasted everybody’s time and taxpayer’s money.” @trish_regannewest poll: only 11% in favor of starting ridiculous impeachment hearings. well let’s see: we have the best economy in history the best employment numbers in history most people working in history highest stock market in history biggest tax and regulation cuts in history......best and newest military (almost totally rebuilt from the depleted military i took over) in history best v.a. in history (choice) and much much more. gee let’s impeach the president. the “squad” (aoc plus 3) and other dems suffer from trump derangement syndrome. crazy!keep america great!guatemala which has been forming caravans and sending large numbers of people some with criminal records to the united states has decided to break the deal they had with us on signing a necessary safe third agreement. we were ready to go. now we are looking at the “ban”........tariffs remittance fees or all of the above. guatemala has not been good. big u.s. taxpayer dollars going to them was cut off by me 9 months ago.when an old wall at the southern border that is crumbling and falling over built in an important section to keep out problems is replaced with a brand new 30 foot high steel and concrete wall the media says no new wall has been built. fake news! building lots of wall!leaving for turning point usa. will be speaking to some of the greatest and smartest young people on the planet. see you there!i was saddened to learn of the recent passing of bob morgenthau a truly great man! bob served as a naval officer in world war ii was an extraordinary us attorney manhattan district attorney and always a warrior for our country that he loved so dearly........i got to know him over his many years as chairman of the police athletic league for which he devoted so much time and energy. bob morgenthau a legend will be greatly missed!budget deal gives great victories to our military and vets keeps out democrat poison pill riders. republicans and democrats in congress need to act asap and support this deal.just watched rep. eric swalwell be asked endless softball questions by @marthamaccallum on @foxnews about the phony witch hunt. he was just forced out of the democrat presidential primary because he polled at zero. fox sure ain’t what it used to be. too bad!so robert mueller has now asked for his long time never trumper lawyer to sit beside him and help with answers. what’s this all about? his lawyer represented the “basement server guy” who got off free in the crooked hillary case. this should not be allowed. rigged witch hunt!so democrats and others can illegally fabricate a crime try pinning it on a very innocent president and when he fights back against this illegal and treasonous attack on our country they call it obstruction? wrong! why didn’t robert mueller investigate the investigators?it was never agreed that robert mueller could use one of his many democrat never trumper lawyers to sit next to him and help him with his answers. this was specifically not agreed to and i would never have agreed to it. the greatest witch hunt in u.s. history by far!why didn’t robert mueller  his band of 18 angry democrats spend any time investigating crooked hillary clinton lyin’  leakin’ james comey lisa page and her psycho lover peter s andy mccabe the beautiful ohr family fusion gps and many more  including himself  andrew w?so why didn’t the highly conflicted robert mueller investigate how and why crooked hillary clinton deleted and acid washed 33000 emails immediately after getting a subpoena from the united states congress? she must have great lawyers!it has been reported that robert mueller is saying that he did not apply and interview for the job of fbi director (and get turned down) the day before he was wrongfully appointed special counsel. hope he doesn’t say that under oath in the we have numerous witnesses to the.....no collusion no

appointed special counsel. hope he doesn’t say that under oath in that we have numerous witnesses to the...“mueller was asked whether or not the investigation was impeded in any way and he said no.” in other words there was no obstruction. @katiepavlich @foxnewsi would like to thank the democrats for holding this morning’s hearing. now after 3 hours robert mueller has to subject himself to #shiftyschiff - an embarrassment to our country!truth is a force of nature!“yesterday changed everything it really did clear the president. he wins.” @ainsleyearhardt  “it changed everything in favor of the president who said all along this investigation is rooted in nothing. mueller was exposed as being best friends with comey. today you say........impeachment you have a party of one. it’s over.” @kilmeade  “nancy said jerry please sit down. very bad idea. we discovered that after putting so much time  energy into the mueller report it turns out mueller didn’t know what was in his report.”

levin on @foxandfriends now! great guy.house republicans should support the two year budget agreement which greatly helps our military and our vets. i am totally with you!we love our law enforcement officers all around this great country. what took place in nyc with water being tossed on nypd officers was a total disgrace. it is time for @nycmayor @billdeblasio to stand up for those who protect our lives and serve us all so well......what took place was completely unacceptable and will not be tolerated. bill de blasio should act immediately!very disappointed in prime minister stefan löfven for being unable to act. sweden has let our african american community down in the united states. i watched the tapes of a$ap rocky and he was being followed and harassed by troublemakers. treat americans fairly! #freerockygive a$ap rocky his freedom. we do so much for sweden but it doesn’t seem to work the other way around. sweden should focus on its real crime problem! #freerockyi am

different from what they used to be during the 2016 primaries  before - proud warriors! now new fox polls which have always been terrible to me (they had me losing big to crooked hillary) have me down to sleepy joe. even considering.........the fact that i have gone through a three year vicious witch hunt perpetrated by the lamestream media in collusion with crooked and the democrat party there can be no way with the greatest economy in u.s. history that i can be losing to the sleepy one. keep america great!apple will not be given tariff wavers or relief for mac pro parts that are made in china. make them in the usa no tariffs!q2 gdp up 2.1% not bad considering we have the very heavy weight of the federal reserve anchor wrapped around our neck. almost no inflation. usa is set to zoom!apple will not be given tariff waiver or relief for mac pro parts that are made in china. make them in the usa no tariffs!the wto is broken when the world’s richest countries claim to be developing countries to avoid wto rules and get special treatment. no more!!! today i directed the u.s. trade representative to take action so that countries stop cheating the system at the expense of the usa!wow! big victory on the wall. the united states supreme court overturns lower court injunction allows southern border wall to proceed. big win for border security and the rule of law!rep elijah cummings has been a brutal bully shouting and screaming at the great men  women of border patrol about conditions at the southern border when actually his baltimore district is far worse and more dangerous. his district is considered the worst in the usa..........as proven last week during a congressional tour the border is clean efficient  well run just very crowded. cumming district is a disgusting rat and rodent infested mess. if he spent more time in baltimore maybe he could help clean up this very dangerous  filthy placewhy is so much money sent to the elijah cummings district when it is considered the worst run and most dangerous anywhere in the united states. no human being would want to live there. where is all this money going? how much is stolen? investigate this corrupt mess immediately!consideration is being given to declaring antifa the gutless radical left wack jobs who go around hitting (only non-fighters) people over the heads with baseball bats a major organization of terror (along with ms-13  others). would make it easier for police to do their job!the democrats were trying mightily to revive the badly  irrevocably tarnished witch hunt hoax until robert mueller put on the greatest display of ineptitude  incompetence that the halls of congress have ever seen. truth is he had no facts on his side. nothing he could do!the dems are now coming out of shock from the terrible mueller performance and are starting to spin impeachment all over again. how sick  disgusting and bad for our country are they. what they are doing is so wrong but they do it anyway. dems have become the do nothing party!such a big victory of our country! “supreme court approves trump administration plan to use military funds for the wall.” @foxnews  we will be fully reimbursed for this expenditure over time by other countries.democrats don’t care about border security. they refuse to give the votes necessary to fix the loopholes and asylum. would be so easy! they want open borders which means crimecrimecrime!we gave nadler and his trump hating dems the complete mueller report (we didn’t have to) and even mueller himself but now that both were a total bust they say it wasn’t good enough. nothing will ever be good enough for them. witch hunt!no collusion no obstruction total exoneration. democrat witch hunt!“one of the biggest things to come out of mueller’s testimony was the fact that when he was asked was there anything that impeded your investigation the answer was a clear unequivocal no.” misty marris  @foxnews  true but many other great “exonerating” things came out.........robert mueller’s testimony and the mueller report itself was a disaster for this illegal democrat inspired witch hunt. it is an embarrassment to the usa that they don’t know how to stop. they can’t help themselves they are totally lost they are clowns!so sad that elijah cummings has been able to do so little for the people of baltimore. statistically baltimore ranks last in almost every major category. cummings has done nothing but milk baltimore dry but the public is getting wise to the bad job that he is doing!the real collusion the conspiracy the crime was between the clinton campaign the dnc fusion gps christopher steele.....(and many others including comey mccabe lisa page and her lover ohr and his wonderful wife and on and on!). @replouiegohmertthe democrats are still doing the russians dirty work as they continue to push the fake crime. media credibility is now shot democrat credibility is shot they’ve wasted over 100 hearings on a hoax they’ve done nothing on infrastructure drug prices trade....@jessebwatters“if it weren’t for donald trump we would never know how corrupt these democrats are we would never know for sure that there was a deep state. now we know it.” @judgejeaninesomeone please explain to nancy pelosi who was recently called racist by those in her own party that there is nothing wrong with bringing out the very obvious fact that congressman elijah cummings has done a very poor job for his district and the city of baltimore. just take.......a look the facts speak far louder than words! the democrats always play the race card when in fact they have done so little for our nation’s great african american people. now lowest unemployment in u.s. history and only getting better. elijah cummings has failed badly!speaking of failing badly has anyone seen what is happening to nancy pelosi’s district in san francisco. it is not even recognizeable lately. something must be done before it is too late. the dems should stop wasting time on the witch hunt hoax and start focusing on our country!“elijah cummings has had his chance to address it (crime  conditions in baltimore) for decades and he hasn’t gotten it done.” @petehegseth @foxandfriends  how can he get it done when he just wants to use his oversight committee to hurt innocent people and divide our country!there is nothing racist in stating plainly what most people already know that elijah cummings has done a terrible job for the people of his district and of baltimore itself. dems always play the race card when they are unable to win with facts. shame!if racist elijah cummings would focus more of his energy on helping the good people of his district and baltimore itself perhaps progress could be made in fixing the mess that he has helped to create over many years of incompetent leadership. his radical “oversight” is a joke!under the trump administration african american unemployment is the lowest (best) in the history of the united states. no president has come close to doing this before! i also created successful opportunity zones. waiting for nancy and elijah to say “thank you mr. president!”i am pleased to announce that highly respected congressman john ratcliffe of texas will be nominated by me to be the director of national intelligence. a former u.s. attorney john will lead and inspire greatness for the country he loves. dan coats the current director will........be leaving office on august 15th. i would like to thank dan for his great service to our country. the acting director will be named shortly.“if the democrats would have closed the loopholes two years ago when president trump asked them to do so none of this stuff would have happened.” @thomashomanice“the democrats hate this president so much they’re forgetting about their duty to secure our border.” @thomashomanice  @stevehiltonx sad but true!law enforcement is at the scene of shootings in gilroy california. reports are that shooter has not yet been apprehended. be careful and safe!baltimore under the leadership of elijah cummings has the worst crime statistics in the nation. 25 years of all talk no action! so tired of listening to the same old bull...next reverend al will show up to complain  protest. nothing will get done for the people in need. sad!if the democrats are going to defend the radical left “squad” and king elijah’s baltimore fail it will be a long road to 2020. the good news for the dems is that they have the fake news media in their pocket!al sharpton would always ask me to go to his events. he would say “it’s a personal favor to me.” seldom but sometimes i would go. it was fine. he came to my office in t.t. during the presidential campaign to apologize for the way he was talking about me. just a conman at work!the e.u. and china will further lower interest rates and pump money into their systems making it much easier for their manufacturers to sell product. in the meantime and with very low inflation our fed does nothing - and probably will do very little by comparison. too bad!crazy bernie sanders recently equated the city of baltimore to a third world country! based on that statement i assume that bernie must now be labeled a racist just as a republican would if he used that term and standard! the fact is baltimore can be brought back maybe..........even to new heights of success and glory but not with king elijah and that crew. when the leaders of baltimore want to see the city rise again i am in a very beautiful oval shaped office waiting for your call!the fed “raised” way too early and way too much. their quantitative tightening was another big mistake. while our country is doing very well the potential wealth creation that was missed especially when measured against our debt is staggering. we are competing with other.........countries that know how to play the game against the u.s. that’s actually why the e.u. was formed....and for china until now the u.s. has been “easy pickens.” the fed has made all of the wrong moves. a small rate cut is not enough but we will win anyway!the republican party has a new star his name is daniel cameron (@djaycameron) and he is running for attorney general of the commonwealth of kentucky........he is tough on crime strong on borders and will fight for our second amendment. daniel will never let you down. he has my full and complete endorsement!just remember the iranians never won a war but never lost a negotiation!senator cindy hyde-smith is doing a great job for the people of mississippi and fully supports our #maga agenda. cindy is tough on crime strong on the border and illegal immigration....elijah cummings never even went to the southern border and then he screams at the very good people who despite congresses failure to fix the loopholes and asylum make it work (crossings are way down and the wall is being built). even with zero dem help border getting strong!baltimore’s numbers are the worst in the united states on crime and the economy. billions of dollars have been pumped in over the years but to no avail. the money was stolen or wasted. ask elijah cummings where it went. he should investigate himself with his oversight committee!“i don’t know what it’s going to take. a lot of democratic run cities all over america look like this it’s not just baltimore unfortunately.” kimberly klacik baltimore journalist  remember vote for trump what the h.... do you have to lose? best unemployment numbers!somali refugees arresed in tucson on way to egypt. they were in touch with an agent posing as a terrorist. one of them stated “the best wake up call is islamic state to get victory or another 9/11.” get smart people! #maga #kag @foxandfriendsdespite the democrats wanting very unsafe open borders  refusing to change the loopholes  asylum tremendous progress is being made the the southern border. we all waited because we assumed the dems would ultimately be forced to change the horrible immigration laws.they didn’t!china is doing very badly worst year in 27 - was supposed to start buying our agricultural product now - no signs that they are doing so. that is the problem with china they just don’t come through. our economy has become much larger than the chinese economy is last 3 years......my team is negotiating with them now but they always change the deal in the end to their benefit. they should probably wait out our election to see if we get one of the democrat stiffs like sleepy joe. then they could make a great deal like in past 30 years and continue...to ripoff the usa even bigger and better than ever before. the problem with them waiting however is that if  when i win the deal that they get will be much tougher than what we are negotiating now...or no deal at all. we have all the cards our past leaders never got it!wow! morning joe  psycho ratings have really crashed. very small audience. people are tired of hearing fake news delivered with an anger that is not to be believed. sad when the show was sane they helped get me elected. thanks! was on all the time. lost all of its juice!....@foxandfriendssenate is working hard on america’s transportation infrastructure act. will have big impact on our highways and roads all across our nation. interest strong from republicans and democrats. do i hear the beautiful word bipartisan? get it done. i am with you!china has lost 5 million jobs and two million manufacturing jobs due to the trump tariffs. trumps got china back on its heels and the united states is doing great. @andypuzder @mariabartiromojust reminded my staff that morning joe  psycho were with me in my room at their request the night i won new hampshire. likewise followed me to other states........don’t watch show but heard mika said i asked to preside over their marriage. not true—does anyone really believe that? they were married by elijah king of baltimore!heading to jamestown virginia. word is the democrats will make it as uncomfortable as possible but that’s ok because today is not about them!wow! a federal judge in the southern district of n.y. completely dismissed a lawsuit brought by the democratic national committee against our historic 2016 campaign for president. the judge said the dnc case was “entirely divorced” from the facts yet another total  complete........vindication  exoneration from the russian wikileaks and every other form of hoax perpetrated by the dnc radical democrats and others. this is really big “stuff” especially coming from a highly respected judge who was appointed by president clinton. the witch hunt ends!such a great victory in court yesterday on the russian hoax the greatest political scam in the history of our country. treason! hopefully the attorney generel of the united states and all of those working with him will find out in great detail what happened. never again!!!!if i hadn’t won the 2016 election we would be in a great recession/depression right now. the people i saw on stage last night  you can add in sleepy joe harris  the rest will lead us into an economic sinkhole the likes of which we have never seen before. with me only up!“the lesser of two socialists is still a socialist!” senator john kennedy of louisianacnn’s don lemon the dumbest man on television insinuated last night while asking a debate “question” that i was a racist when in fact i am “the least racist person in the world.” perhaps someone should explain to don that he is supposed to be neutral unbiased  fair.........or is he too dumb (stupid} to understand that. no wonder cnn’s ratings (msnbc’s also) have gone down the tubes - and will stay there until they bring credibility back to the newsroom. don’t hold your breath!the prosecutors who lost the case against seal eddie gallagher (who i released from solitary confinement so he could fight his case properly) were ridiculously given a navy achievement medal........to information that may have been obtained from opposing lawyers and for giving immunity in a totally incompetent fashion. i have directed the secretary of the navy richard spencer  chief of naval operations john richardson to immediately withdraw and rescind the awards....what the market wanted to hear from jay powell and the federal reserve was that this was the beginning of a lengthy and aggressive rate-cutting cycle which would keep pace with china the european union and other countries around the world........as usual powell let us down but at least he is ending quantitative tightening which shouldn’t have started in the first place - no inflation. we are winning anyway but i am certainly not getting much help from the federal reserve!very low ratings for the democratic debate last night — they’re desperate for trump!experts stated that the fed should not have tightened and then waited too long to undo their mistake. james bullard of st. louis fed said they waited too long to correct the mistake that they made last december. “mistake powell cut rate and then he started talking.” @loudobbsthe cages for kids were built by the obama administration in 2014. he had the policy of child separation. i ended it even as i realized that more families would then come to the border! @cnnthe people on the stage tonight and last were not those that will either make america great again or keep america great! our country now is breaking records in almost every category from stock market to military to unemployment. we have prosperity  success like never before.....it will soon be time to choose to keep and build upon that prosperity and success or let it go. we are respected again all around the world. keep it that way! i said i will never let you down and i haven’t. we will only grow bigger better and stronger together!congratulations to kelly knight craft of #kentucky on her confirmation as united nations ambassador. after having served so admirably as ambassador to canada  having done an outstanding job no matter how difficult the task kelly will be fantastic at the united nations. winner!china iran  other foreign countries are looking at the democrat candidates and “drooling” over the small prospect that they could be dealing with them in the not too distant future. they would be able to rip off our beloved usa like never before. with president trump no way!budget deal is phenomenal for our great military our vets and jobs jobs jobs! two year deal gets us past the election. go for it republicans there is always plenty of time to cut!big rally tonight in cincinnati ohio. see you there! p.s. our country is doing great!our representatives have just returned from china where they had constructive talks having to do with a future trade deal. we thought we had a deal with china three months ago but sadly china decided to re-negotiate the deal prior to signing. more recently china agreed to......buy agricultural product from the u.s. in large quantities but did not do so. additionally my friend president xi said that he would stop the sale of fentanyl to the united states – this never happened and many americans continue to die! trade talks are continuing and......during the talks the u.s. will start on september 1st putting a small additional tariff of 10% on the remaining 300 billion dollars of goods and products coming from china into our country. this does not include the 250 billion dollars already tariffed at 25%......we look forward to continuing our positive dialogue with china on a comprehensive trade deal and feel that the future between our two countries will be a very bright one!i would like to thank two great iowa senators @chuckgrassley and @senjoniernst - for their support today on the spending bill. their vote and the vote of other republicans and democrats helped get this done in a bipartisan fashion. thank you all!really bad news! the baltimore house of elijah cummings was robbed. too bad!kim jong un and north korea tested 3 short range missiles over the last number of days. these missiles tests are not a violation of our signed singapore agreement nor was there discussion of short range missiles when we shook hands. there may be a united nations violation but.......chairman kim does not want to disappoint me with a violation of trust there is far too much for north korea to gain - the potential as a country under kim jong un’s leadership is unlimited. also there is far too much to lose. i may be wrong but i believe that..........chariman kim has a great and beautiful vision for his country and only the united states with me as president can make that vision come true. he will do the right thing because he is far too smart not to and he does not want to disappoint his friend president trump!a$ap rocky released from prison and on his way home to the united states from sweden. it was a rocky week get home asap a$ap!our great republican congressman john ratcliffe is being treated very unfairly by the lamestream media. rather than going through months of slander and libel i explained to john how miserable it would be for him and his family to deal with these people........john has therefore decided to stay in congress where he has done such an outstanding job representing the people of texas and our country. i will be announcing my nomination for dni shortly.countries are coming to us wanting to negotiate real trade deals not the one sided horror show deals made by past administrations. they don’t want to be targeted for tariffs by the u.s.things are going along very well with china. they are paying us tens of billions of dollars made possible by their monetary devaluations and pumping in massive amounts of cash to keep their system going. so far our consumer is paying nothing - and no inflation. no help from fed!terrible shootings in elpaso texas. reports are very bad many killed. working with state and local authorities and law enforcement. spoke to governor to pledge total support of federal government. god be with you all!today’s shooting in el paso texas was not only tragic it was an act of cowardice. i know that i stand with everyone in this country to condemn today’s hateful act. there are no reasons or excuses that will ever justify killing innocent people........melania and i send our heartfelt thoughts and prayers to the great people of texas.today’s shooting in el paso texas was not only tragic it was an act of cowardice. i know that i stand with everyone in this country to condemn today’s hateful act. there are no reasons or excuses that will ever justify killing innocent people........melania and i send our heartfelt thoughts and prayers to the great people of texas.the fbi local and state law enforcement are working together in el paso and in dayton ohio. information is rapidly being accumulated in dayton. much has already be learned in el paso. law enforcement was very rapid in both instances. updates will be given throughout the day!god bless the people of el paso texas. god bless the people of dayton ohio.god bless the people of el paso texas. god bless the people of dayton ohio.we cannot let those killed in el paso texas and dayton ohio die in vain. likewise for those so seriously wounded. we can never forget them and those many who came before them. republicans and democrats must come together and get strong background checks perhaps marrying........this legislation with desperately needed immigration reform. we must have something good if not great come out of these two tragic events!the media has a big responsibility to life and safety in our country. fake news has contributed greatly to the anger and rage that has built up over many years. news coverage has got to start being fair balanced and unbiased or these terrible problems will only get worse!china dropped the price of their currency to an almost a historic low. it’s called “currency manipulation.” are you listening federal reserve? this is a major violation which will greatly weaken china over time!....used currency manipulation to steal our businesses and factories hurt our jobs depress our workers’ wages and harm our farmers’ prices. not anymore!china is intent on continuing to receive the hundreds of billions of dollars they have been taking from the u.s. with unfair trade practices and currency manipulation. so one-sided it should have been stopped many years ago!“did george bush ever condemn president obama after sandy hook. president obama had 32 mass shootings during his reign. not many people said obama is out of control. mass shootings were happening before the president even thought about running for pres.” @kilmeade @foxandfriends“it’s political season and the election is around the corner. they want to continue to push that racist narrative.” @ainsleyearhardt @foxandfriends  and i am the least racist person. black hispanic and asian unemployment is the lowest (best) in the history of the united states!@sundarpichai of google was in the oval office working very hard to explain how much he liked me what a great job the administration is doing that google was not involved with china’s military that they didn’t help crooked hillary over me in the 2016 election and that they.......are not planning to illegally subvert the 2020 election despite all that has been said to the contrary. it all sounded good until i watched kevin cernekee a google engineer say terrible things about what they did in 2016 and that they want to “make sure that trump losses.......in 2020.” lou dobbs stated that this is a fraud on the american public. @peterschweizer stated with certainty that they suppressed negative stories on hillary clinton and boosted negative stories on donald ttump. all very illegal. we are watching google very closely!massive amounts of money from china and other parts of the world is pouring into the united states for reasons of safety investment and interest rates! we are in a very strong position. companies are also coming to the u.s. in big numbers. a beautiful thing to watch!as they have learned in the last two years our great american farmers know that china will not be able to hurt them in that their president has stood with them and done what no other president would do - and i’ll do it again next year if necessary!.@sundarpichai of google was in the oval office working very hard to explain how much he liked me what a great job the administration is doing that google was not involved with china’s military that they didn’t help crooked hillary over me in the 2016 election  that they...... are not planning to illegally subvert the 2020 election despite all that has been said to the contrary. it all sounded good until i watched kevin cernekee a google engineer say terrible

texas tomorrow to meet with first responders law enforcement and some of the victims of the terrible shootings.“california is trying to meddle with a ballot in order to oppose president trump and it’s clearly something california is not allowed to do. it violates the right of the republican party or any party to choose its leaders under the free speech clause and under the 14th.........amendment.” john yoo. @ingrahamangle  former governor jerry brown vetoed the same bill in that it was ridiculous and totally unconstitutional. just more of the record setting presidential harassment. don’t feel badly new york state is far worse!beto (phony name to indicate hispanic heritage) o’rourke who is embarrassed by my last visit to the great state of texas where i trounced him and is now even more embarrassed by polling at 1% in the democrat primary should respect the victims  law enforcement -  be quiet!south korea has agreed to pay substantially more money to the united states in order to defend itself from north korea. over the past many decades the u.s. has been paid very little by south korea but last year at the request of president trump south korea paid $990000000.....talks have begun to further increase payments to the united states. south korea is a very wealthy nation that now feels an obligation to contribute to the military defense provided by the united states of america. the relationship between the two countries is a very good one!“trump urges unity vs. racism” was the correct description in the first headline by the failing new york times but it was quickly changed to “assailing hate but not guns” after the radical left democrats went absolutely crazy! fake news - that’s what we’re up against.....”this is an astounding development in journalism. i’ve never seen it happen before i’ve just never seen anything like this! is that journalism today? i don’t think so!” mark penn former clinton advisor. @tuckercarlson after 3 years i almost got a good headline from the times!“meanwhile the dayton ohio shooter had a history of supporting political figures like bernie sanders elizabeth warren and antifa.” @oann  i hope other news outlets will report this as opposed to fake news. thank you!“three more central banks cut rates.” our problem is not china - we are stronger than ever money is pouring into the u.s. while china is losing companies by the thousands to other countries and their currency is under siege - our problem is a federal reserve that is too.........proud to admit their mistake of acting too fast and tightening too much (and that i was right!). they must cut rates bigger and faster and stop their ridiculous quantitative tightening now. yield curve is at too wide a margin and no inflation! incompetence is a.........terrible thing to watch especially when things could be taken care of sooo easily. we will win anyway but it would be much easier if the fed understood which they don’t that we are competing against other countries all of whom want to do well at our expense!watching sleepy joe biden making a speech. sooo boring! the lamestream media will die in the ratings and clicks with this guy. it will be over for them not to mention the fact that our country will do poorly with him. it will be one big crash but at least china will be happy!just left dayton ohio where i met with the victims  families law enforcement medical staff  first responders. it was a warm  wonderful visit. tremendous enthusiasm  even love. then i saw failed presidential candidate (0%) sherrod brown  mayor whaley totally.........misrepresenting what took place inside of the hospital. their news conference after i left for el paso was a fraud. it bore no resemblance to what took place with those incredible people that i was so lucky to meet and spend time with. they were all amazing!owatching fake news cnn is better than watching shepard smith the lowest rated show on @foxnews. actually whenever possible i turn to @oann!i don’t know who juaquin castro is other than the lesser brother of a failed presidential candidate (1%) who makes a fool of himself every time he opens his mouth. juaquin is not the man that his brother is but his brother according to most is not much. keep fighting juaquin!i don’t know who joaquin castro is other than the lesser brother of a failed presidential candidate (1%) who makes a fool of himself every time he opens his mouth. joaquin is not the man that his brother is but his brother according to most is not much. keep fighting joaquin!leaving el paso for the white house. what great people i met there and in dayton ohio. the fake news worked overtime trying to disparage me and the two trips but it just didn’t work. the love respect  enthusiasm were there for all to see. they have been through so much. sad!the dems new weapon is actually their old weapon one which they never cease to use when they are down or run out of facts racism! they are truly disgusting! they even used it on nancy pelosi. i will be putting out a list of all people who have been so (ridiculously) accused!....i am so amazed that msnbc  cnn can keep putting on over and over again people that have no idea what i am all about and yet they speak as experts on “trump.” same people since long before the 2016 election and how did that work out for the haters and losers. not well!as your president one would think that i would be thrilled with our very strong dollar. i am not! the fed’s high interest rate level in comparison to other countries is keeping the dollar high making it more difficult for our great manufacturers like caterpillar boeing.........john deere our car companies  others to compete on a level playing field. with substantial fed cuts (there is no inflation) and no quantitative tightening the dollar will make it possible for our companies to win against any competition. we have the greatest companies.......in the world there is nobody even close but unfortunately the same cannot be said about our federal reserve. they have called it wrong at every step of the way and we are still winning. can you imagine what would happen if they actually called it right?iran is in serious financial trouble. they want desperately to talk to the u.s. but are given mixed signals from all of those purporting to represent us including president macron of france........i know emmanuel means well as do all others but nobody speaks for the united states but the united states itself. no one is authorized in any way shape or form to represent us!....coincides with the retirement of dan coats. a new acting director of national intelligence will be named shortly.i am pleased to inform you that the honorable joseph maguire current director of the national counterterrorism center will be named acting director of national intelligence effective august 15th. admiral maguire has a long and distinguished....rod blagojevich the former governor of illinois was sentenced to 14 years in prison. he has served 7 years. many people have asked that i study the possibility of commuting his sentence in that it was a very severe one. white house staff is continuing the review of this matter.serious discussions are taking place between house and senate leadership  on meaningful background checks. i have also been speaking to the nra and others so that their very strong views can be fully represented and respected. guns should not be placed in the hands of.........mentally ill or deranged people. i am the biggest second amendment person there is but we all must work together for the good and safety of our country. common sense things can be done that are good for everyone!liberal hollywood is racist at the highest level and with great anger and hate! they like to call themselves “elite” but they are not elite. in fact it is often the people that they so strongly oppose that are actually the elite. the movie coming out is made in order........to inflame and cause chaos. they create their own violence and then try to blame others. they are the true racists and are very bad for our country!maggie haberman of the failing @nytimes reported that i was annoyed by the lack of cameras inside the hospitals in dayton  el paso when in fact i was the one who stated very strongly that i didn’t want the fake news inside  told my people not to let them in. fake reporting!in a letter to me sent by kim jong un he stated very nicely that he would like to meet and start negotiations as soon as the joint u.s./south korea joint exercise are over. it was a long letter much of it complaining about the ridiculous and expensive exercises. it was.........also a small apology for testing the short range missiles and that this testing would stop when the exercises end. i look forward to seeing kim jong un in the not too distant future! a nuclear free north korea will lead to one of the most successful countries in the world!never has the press been more inaccurate unfair or corrupt! we are not fighting the democrats they are easy we are fighting the seriously dishonest and unhinged lamestream media. they have gone totally crazy. make america great again!got to see by accident wacko comedian bill maher’s show - so many lies. he said patients in el paso hospital didn’t want to meet with me. wrong! had really great meetings with numerous patients. said i was on vacation. wrong! long planned fix up of w.h. stay here rather than......cause big disruption by going to manhattan. working almost all of the time including evenings. don’t have to be in w.h. to do that...and sooo many other false statements. he is right about one thing though. i will win again in 2020. otherwise he pays 95% in taxes!china wants to make a deal so badly. thousands of companies are leaving because of the tariffs they must stem the flow. at the same time china may be hoping for a democrat to win so they could continue the great ripoff of america  the theft of hundreds of billions of $’s!think how wonderful it is to be able to fight back and show to so many how totally dishonest the fake news media really is. it may be the most corrupt and disgusting business (almost) there is! make america great again!joe biden just said “we believe in facts not truth.” does anybody really believe he is mentally fit to be president? we are “playing” in a very big and complicated world. joe doesn’t have a clue!anthony scaramucci who was quickly terminated (11 days) from a position that he was totally incapable of handling now seems to do nothing but television as the all time expert on “president trump.” like many other so-called television experts he knows very little about me..........other than the fact that this administration has probably done more than any other administration in its first 2 1/2 years of existence. anthony who would do anything to come back in should remember the only reason he is on tv and it’s not for being the mooch!so funny to watch little donny deutsch on tv with his own failing show. when i did the apprentice donny would call me (along with @erinburnett  others) and beg to be on that very successful show. he had the tv “bug”  i would let him come on though he ( erin) had very little....tv talent. then during the 2016 election i would watch as joe scarborough  his very angry psycho wife(?) would push donny to the point of total humiliation. he would never fight back because he wanted to stay on tv even on a very low rated show all in the name of ambition!scaramucci who like so many others had nothing to do with my election victory is only upset that i didn’t want him back in the administration (where he desperately wanted to be). also i seldom had time to return his many calls to me. he just wanted to be on tv!the united states is learning much from the failed missile explosion in russia. we have similar though more advanced technology. the russian “skyfall” explosion has people worried about the air around the facility and far beyond. not good!through massive devaluation of their currency and pumping vast sums of money into their system the tens of billions of dollars that the u.s. is receiving is a gift from china. prices not up no inflation. farmers getting more than china would be spending. fake news won’t report!would chris cuomo be given a red flag for his recent rant? filthy language and a total loss of control. he shouldn’t be allowed to have any weapon. he’s nuts!as usual china said they were going to be buying “big” from our great american farmers. so far they have not done what they said. maybe this will be different!all the news that’s not fit to print! “the new york times is no longer the paper we grew up with. it is no longer a news organization. it is now an agenda driven organization out to change the country (for the worse!).” michael goodwin highly respected new york post columnist.many are blaming me and the united states for the problems going on in hong kong. i can’t imagine why?our intelligence has informed us that the chinese government is moving troops to the border with hong kong. everyone should be calm and safe!just landed in pennsylvania. looking forward to making a speech on energy. so important!it always happens! when a conservative does even a fraction of what chris cuomo did with his lunatic ranting raving  cursing they get destroyed by the fake news. but when a liberal democrat like chris cuomo does it republicans immediately come to his defense. we never learn!no debate on election security should go forward without first agreeing that voter id (identification) must play a very strong part in any final agreement. without voter id it is all so meaningless!great interview of ron vitiello former acting ice director by @jessebwatters on @foxnews about all of the work that is being ( has been) done on our southern border. thanks ron terrific job! now if only the democrats would fix the loopholes  asylum.“the fed has got to do something! the fed is the central bank of the united states not the central bank of the world.” mark grant  @varneyco  correct! the federal reserve acted far too quickly and now is very very late. too bad so much to gain on the upside!“so far you’ve had tariffs imposed on 300 billion dollars worth of chinese products but you can’t tell me that it has hurt our economy... it really hasn’t led to any kind of serious rise in prices at the consumer level.” @varneyco  @foxbusiness  and we are taking in $billions!the great charles payne @cvpayne correctly stated that fed chair jay powell made two enormous mistakes. 1. when he said “mid cycle adjustment.” 2. we’re data dependent.  “he did not do the right thing.” i agree (to put it mildly!). @varneycowe are winning big time against china. companies  jobs are fleeing. prices to us have not gone up and in some cases have come down. china is not our problem though hong kong is not helping. our problem is with the fed. raised too much  too fast. now too slow to cut......spread is way too much as other countries say thank you to clueless jay powell and the federal reserve. germany and many others are playing the game! crazy inverted yield curve! we should easily be reaping big rewards  gains but the fed is holding us back. we will win!good things were stated on the call with china the other day. they are eating the tariffs with the devaluation of their currency and “pouring” money into their system. the american consumer is fine with or without the september date but much good will come from the short.....i know president xi of china very well. he is a great leader who very much has the respect of his people. he is also a good man in a “tough business.” i have zero doubt that if president xi wants to quickly and humanely solve the hong kong problem he can do it. personal meeting?go out and get andrew mccarthy’s new book “ball of collusion.” “supervision became the investigator and when they pushed the envelope there was nobody there to tell them no. it goes right to the president (obama). plenty of information that obama was informed  knew exactly.......what they were doing. there’s plenty of indication we don’t have to speculate.” @stevedoocy “holy cow got to read this book.” @ainsleyearhardt “wow!”  @foxandfriends  a very serious situation. can never be allowed to happen again! drain the swampthe philadelphia shooter should never have been allowed to be on the streets. he had a long and very dangerous criminal record. looked like he was having a good time after his capture and after wounding so many police. long sentence - must get much tougher on street crime!it would show great weakness if israel allowed rep. omar and rep.tlaib to visit. they hate israel  all jewish people  there is nothing that can be said or done to change their minds. minnesota and michigan will have a hard time putting them back in office. they are a disgrace!our great farmers know how important it is to win on trade. they will be the big winners!wow! the deputy editor of the failing new york times was just demoted. should have been fired! totally biased and inaccurate reporting. the paper is a fraud zero credibility. fake news takes another hit but this time a big one!the fake news media is doing everything they can to crash the economy because they think that will be bad for me and my re-election. the problem they have is that the economy is way too strong and we will soon be winning big on trade and everyone knows that including china!“if they don’t get this trade deal with the u.s. done china could have it first recession (or worse!) in years. there’s disinvestment in china right now. also the fed is too tight (i agree).” steve moore heritage foundationwalmart a great indicator as to how the u.s. is doing just released outstanding numbers. our country unlike others is doing great! don’t let the fake news convince you otherwise.thank you to my good friend chuck canterbury for 16 years of service to the fraternal order of police and our great men and women in blue. you are an incredible patriot!senator jim risch of the great state of idaho has been an incredible supporter of our agenda! he is tough on crime strong on borders and will continue to fight for our second amendment. jim will never let you down. he has my full and complete endorsement!rep. tlaib wrote a letter to israeli officials desperately wanting to visit her grandmother. permission was quickly granted whereupon tlaib obnoxiously turned the approval down a complete setup. the only real winner here is tlaib’s grandmother. she doesn’t have to see her now!like it or not tlaib and omar are fast becoming the face of the democrat party. cortez (aoc) is fuming not happy about this!just completed a very good meeting on afghanistan. many on the opposite side of this 19 year war and us are looking to make a deal - if possible!having dinner tonight with tim cook of apple. they will be spending vast sums of money in the u.s. great!great time in new hampshire last night. placed was maxed out totally packed with thousands coming to the arena floor at start. thousands more outside that were not allowed in per code. energy was really great to see. we will win new hampshire in 2020!major consideration is being given to naming antifa an “organization of terror.” portland is being watched very closely. hopefully the mayor will be able to properly do his job!the failing new york times in one of the most devastating portrayals of bad journalism in history got caught by a leaker that they are shifting  from their phony russian collusion narrative (the mueller report  his testimony were a total disaster) to a racism witch hunt..........”journalism” has reached a new low in the history of our country. it is nothing more than an evil propaganda machine for the democrat party. the reporting is so false biased and evil that it has now become a very sick joke...but the public is aware! #crookedjournalismwith all that this administration has accomplished think what my poll numbers would be if we had an honest media which we do not!make america great again!we are doing very well with china and talking!juan williams at @foxnews is so pathetic and yet when he met me in the fox building lobby he couldn’t have been nicer as he asked me to take a picture of him and me for his family. yet he is always nasty and wrong!our economy is the best in the world by far. lowest unemployment ever within almost all categories. poised for big growth after trade deals are completed. import prices down china eating tariffs. helping targeted farmers from big tariff money coming in. great future for usa!house democrats want to take action against israel because it is fighting back against two (maybe four) people that have said unthinkably bad things about it  the israeli people. dems have such disdain for israel! what happened? aoc plus 4 is the new face of the democrat party!the new york times will be out of business soon after i leave office hopefully in 6 years. they have zero credibility and are losing a fortune even now especially after their massive unfunded liability. i’m fairly certain they’ll endorse me just to keep it all going!anthony scaramucci is a highly unstable “nut job” who was with other candidates in the primary who got shellaced and then unfortunately wheedled his way into my campaign. i barely knew him until his 11 days of gross incompetence-made a fool of himself bad on tv. abused staff......got fired. wrote a very nice book about me just recently. now the book is a lie? said his wife was driving him crazy “something big” was happening with her. getting divorced. he was a mental wreck. we didn’t want him around. now fake news puts him on like he was my buddy!great cohesion inside the republican party the best i have ever seen. despite all of the fake news my poll numbers are great. new internal polls show them to be the strongest we’ve had so far! think what they’d be if i got fair media coverage!anthony scaramucci is a highly unstable “nut job” who was with other candidates in the primary who got shellacked  then unfortunately wheedled his way into my campaign. i barely knew him until his 11 days of gross incompetence-made a fool

getting divorced. he was a mental wreck. we didn’t want him around. now fake news puts him on like he was my buddy!our economy is very strong despite the horrendous lack of vision by jay powell and the fed but the democrats are trying to “will” the economy to be bad for purposes of the 2020 election.  very selfish! our dollar is so strong that it is sadly hurting other parts of the world........the fed rate over a fairly short period of time should be reduced by at least 100 basis points with perhaps some quantitative easing as well. if that happened our economy would be even better and the world economy would be greatly and quickly enhanced-good for everyone!wow report just out! google manipulated from 2.6 million to 16 million votes for hillary clinton in 2016 election! this was put out by a clinton supporter not a trump supporter! google should be sued. my victory was even bigger than thought! @judicialwatchspoke to my two good friends prime minister modi of india and prime minister khan of pakistan regarding trade strategic partnerships and most importantly for india and pakistan to work towards reducing tensions in kashmir. a tough situation but good conversations!great discussion with prime minister @borisjohnson today. we talked about brexit and how we can move rapidly on a us-uk free trade deal. i look forward to meeting with boris this weekend at the @g7 in france!sorry i don’t buy rep. tlaib’s tears. i have watched her violence craziness and most importantly words for far too long. now tears? she hates israel and all jewish people. she is an anti-semite. she and her 3 friends are the new face of the democrat party. live with it!denmark is a very special country with incredible people but based on prime minister mette frederiksen’s comments that she would have no interest in discussing the purchase of greenland i will be postponing our meeting scheduled in two weeks for another time........the prime minister was able to save a great deal of expense and effort for both the united states and denmark by being so direct. i thank her for that and look forward to rescheduling sometime in the future!....like he’s the king of israel. they love him like he is the second coming of god...but american jews don’t know him or like him. they don’t even know what they’re doing or saying anymore. it makes no sense! but that’s ok if he keeps doing what he’s doing he’s good for..........all jews blacks gays everyone. and importantly he’s good for everyone in america who wants a job.” wow!  @newsmax  @foxandfriends @oannbrandon judd president national border patrol council. “this will effectively end catch and release and curb illegal entries.”rep tlaib wants to cut off aid to israel. this is the new face the of democrat party? read the aoc plus 3 statements on their hatred of jews and israel. check out rep. omar (the great people of minnesota won’t stand for this).“the speed bump has been missteps by the federal reserve.” @charlespayne2nd  @foxandfriends  so true!“the speed bump has been missteps by the federal reserve.” @cvpayne  @foxandfriends  so true!the fake news lamestream media is doing everything possible the “create” a u.s. recession even though the numbers  facts are working totally in the opposite direction. they would be willing to hurt many people but that doesn’t matter to them. our economy is sooo strong sorry!doing great with china and other trade deals. the only problem we have is jay powell and the fed. he’s like a golfer who can’t putt has no touch. big u.s. growth if he does the right thing big cut - but don’t count on him! so far he has called it wrong and only let us down.........we are competing with many countries that have a far lower interest rate and we should be lower than them. yesterday “highest dollar in u.s.history.” no inflation. wake up federal reserve. such growth potential almost like never before!my proposal to the politically correct automobile companies would lower the average price of a car to consumers by more than $3000 while at the same time making the cars substantially safer. engines would run smoother. very little impact on the environment! foolish executives!so germany is paying zero interest and is actually being paid to borrow money while the u.s. a far stronger and more important credit is paying interest and just stopped (i hope!) quantitative tightening. strongest dollar in history very tough on exports. no inflation!.........where is the federal reserve?....because of me these countries have agreed to pay one hundred billion dollars more - but still way short of what they should pay for the incredible military protection provided. sorry!the legendary henry ford and alfred p. sloan the founders of ford motor company and general motors are “rolling over” at the weakness of current car company executives willing to spend more money on a car that is not as safe or good and cost $3000 more to consumers. crazy!henry ford would be very disappointed if he saw his modern-day descendants wanting to build a much more expensive car that is far less safe and doesn’t work as well because execs don’t want to fight california regulators. car companies should know....germany sells 30 year bonds offering negative yields. germany competes with the usa. our federal reserve does not allow us to do what we must do. they put us at a disadvantage against our competition. strong dollar no inflation! they move like quicksand. fight or go home!the economy is doing really well. the federal reserve can easily make it record setting! the question is being asked why are we paying much more in interest than germany and certain other countries? be early (for a change) not late. let america win big rather than just win!just heard that sean spicer will be on “dancing with the stars.” he will do great. a terrific person who loves our country dearly!just concluded a very good meeting on preventing mass shootings. talks are ongoing w/ both republicans  democrats. we are likewise engaging with lawful gun owners survivors grieving family members law enforcement the nra mental health professionals and school officials......i am hopeful congress will engage with my team to pass meaningful legislation that will make a real difference and most importantly save lives!check out a fantastic new book “still winning – why america went all in on donald trump-and why we must do it again” by the great writer @charleshurt. an excellent read. thank you!.@sencorygardner has done a fantastic job representing the people of colorado. he really knows how to win. strong on crime borders  the 2nd a cory fights hard for our military  vets. john hickenlooper is badly damaged after his horrible run for president. big primary trouble!94% approval rating within the  republican party. thank you!the economy is strong and good whereas the rest of the world is not doing so well. despite this the fake news media together with their partner the democrat party are working overtime to convince people that we are in or will soon be going into a recession. they are.......willing to lose their wealth or a big part of it just for the possibility of winning the election. but it won’t work because i always find a way to win especially for the people! the greatest political movement in the history of our country will have another big win in 2020!now the fed can show their stuff!as usual the fed did nothing! it is incredible that they can “speak” without knowing or asking what i am doing which will be announced shortly. we have a very strong dollar and a very weak fed. i will work “brilliantly” with both and the u.s. will do great...as usual the fed did nothing! it is incredible that they can “speak” without knowing or asking what i am doing which will be announced shortly. we have a very strong dollar and a very weak fed. i will work “brilliantly” with both and the u.s. will do great...our country has lost stupidly trillions of dollars with china over many years. they have stolen our intellectual property at a rate of hundreds of billions of dollars a year  they want to continue. i won’t let that happen! we don’t need china and frankly would be far........better off without them. the vast amounts of money made and stolen by china from the united states year after year for decades will and must stop. our great american companies are hereby ordered to immediately start looking for an alternative to china including bringing......your companies home and making your products in the usa. i will be responding to china’s tariffs this afternoon. this is a great opportunity for the united states. also i am ordering all carriers including fed ex amazon ups and the post office to search for  refuse........all deliveries of fentanyl from china (or anywhere else!). fentanyl kills 100000 americans a year. president xi said this would stop - it didn’t. our economy because of our gains in the last 2 1/2 years is much larger than that of china. we will keep it that way!the dow is down 573 points perhaps on the news that representative seth moulton whoever that may be has dropped out of the 2020 presidential race!....sadly past administrations have allowed china to get so far ahead of fair and balanced trade that it has become a great burden to the american taxpayer. as president i can no longer allow this to happen! in the spirit of achieving fair trade we must balance this very.......additionally the remaining 300 billion dollars of goods and products from china that was being taxed from september 1st at 10% will now be taxed at 15%. thank you for your attention to this matter!just spoke with president @jairbolsonaro of brazil. our future trade prospects are very exciting and our relationship is strong perhaps stronger than ever before. i told him if the united states can help with the amazon rainforest fires we stand ready to assist!thank you to @diamondandsilk for the really nice words and thoughts on @loudobbs tonight hosted by lou’s friend @davidasmanfox. great job by all. p.s. check out these two great women on tour tomorrow night in nyc at the marriott marquis hotel broadway. have fun!for all of the fake news reporters that don’t have a clue as to what the law is relative to presidential powers china etc. try looking at the emergency economic powers act of 1977. case closed!when i looked up to the sky and jokingly said “i am the chosen one” at a press conference two days ago referring to taking on trade with china little did i realize that the media would claim that i had a “messiah complex.” they knew i was kidding being sarcastic and just........having fun. i was smiling as i looked up and around. the many reporters with me were smiling also. they knew the truth...and yet when i saw the reporting cnn msnbc and other fake news outlets covered it as serious news  me thinking of myself as the messiah. no more trust!just had lunch with french president @emanuelmacrone. many good things are happening for both of our countries. big weekend with other world leaders!“face it you probably got a tax cut!” this was a new york times headline and it is very true. if republicans take back the house and keep the senate and presidency one of our first acts will be to approve a major middle income tax cut! democrats only want to raise your taxes!just had lunch with french president @emmanuelmacron. many good things are happening for both of our countries. big weekend with other world leaders!looking forward to helping new york city and governor @andrewcuomo complete the long anticipated and partially built second avenue subway. would be extended to east 125th street in harlem. long in the making they now have the team that can get it done!north carolina governor cooper vetoed a bill that would have required sheriffs to cooperate with ice. this is a terrible decision for the great people of north carolina. he should reverse his decision and get back to the basics of fighting crime!france and president @emanuelmacrone have done a really great job thus far with a very important g-7. lunch with emanuel was the best meeting we have yet had. likewise evening meeting with world leaders went very well. progress being made!france and president @emmanuelmacron have done a really great job thus far with a very important g-7. lunch with emmanuel was the best meeting we have yet had. likewise evening meeting with world leaders went very well. progress being made!the media is destroying the free press! mark levin. so true!before i arrived in france the fake and disgusting news was saying that relations with the 6 others countries in the g-7 are very tense and that the two days of meetings will be a disaster. just like they are trying to force a recession they are trying to “will” america into......bad economic times the worse the better anything to make my election more difficult to win. well we are having very good meetings the leaders are getting along very well and our country economically is doing great - the talk of the world!such false and inaccurate reporting thus far on the g-7. the fake news knows this but they can’t help themselves! leaving now to have breakfast with boris j.happy birthday regis a truly special man!so @donnabrazile gives crooked hillary the questions and now she’s on @foxnews!big trade deal just agreed to with prime minister abe of japan. will be great for our farmers ranchers and more. really big corn purchase!the question i was asked most today by fellow world leaders who think the usa is doing so well and is stronger than ever before happens to be “mr. president why does the american media hate your country so much? why are they rooting for it to fail?”in france we are all laughing at how knowingly inaccurate the u.s. reporting of events and conversations at the g-7 is. these leaders and many others are getting a major case study of fake news at it’s finest! they’ve got it all wrong from iran to china tariffs to boris!.@stevehiltonx “the democrats statements about donald trump are lies. here are the facts.” i will soon be posting the entire segment. too much positive news too many good things to tweet. please be sure to watch! thank you steve hilton for being a real pro and not being afraid!the story by axios that president trump wanted to blow up large hurricanes with nuclear weapons prior to reaching shore is ridiculous. i never said this. just more fake news!just returned to washington from france and the very successful g-7 only to find that the fake news is still trying to perpetuate the phony story that i wanted to use nuclear weapons to blow up hurricanes before they reach shore. this is so ridiculous never happened!starting to look good for the highly respected prime minister of the italian republic giuseppi conte. represented italy powerfully at the g-7. loves his country greatly  works well with the usa. a very talented man who will hopefully remain prime minister!i have gotten to know president @jairbolsonaro well in our dealings with brazil. he is working very hard on the amazon fires and in all respects doing a great job for the people of brazil - not easy. he and his country have the full and complete support of the usa!starting to look good for the highly respected prime minister of the italian republic giuseppe conte. represented italy powerfully at the g-7. loves his country greatly  works well with the usa. a very talented man who will hopefully remain prime minister!no bedbugs at doral. the radical left democrats upon hearing that the perfectly located (for the next g-7) doral national miami was under consideration for the next g-7 spread that false and nasty rumor. not nice!the g-7 was a great success for the usa and all. lamestream media coverage bore no relationship to what actually happened in france - fake news. it was great!the federal reserve loves watching our manufacturers struggle with their exports to the benefit of other parts of the world. has anyone looked at what almost all other countries are doing to take advantage of the good old usa? our fed has been calling it wrong for too long!.@judgejeanine pirro is following up her #1 best seller with another book that is destined to also be #1 – “radicals resistance and revenge: the left\\'s plot to remake america.” out today go get it!the g7 in france was so successful and yet when i came back and read the corrupt and fake news and watched numerous networks it was not even recognizable from what actually took place at the great g7 event!it is amazing that i can be at 51% with zogby when the fake  corrupt news is almost 100% against me. great job mr. president!they do stories so big on elizabeth “pocahontas” warren’s crowd sizes adding many more people than are actually there and yet my crowds which are far bigger get no coverage at all. fake news!axios (whatever that is) sat back and said geeeee let’s see what can we make up today to embarrass the president? then they said “why don’t we say he wants to bomb a hurricane that should do it!” the media in our country is totally out of control!can you believe it? i’m at 94% approval in the republican party and have three stooges running against me. one is “mr. appalachian trail” who was actually in argentina for bad reasons....can you believe it? i’m at 94% approval in the republican party and have three stooges running against me. one is “mr. appalachian trail” who was actually in argentina for bad reasons........another is a one-time bad congressman from illinois who lost in his second term by a landslide then failed in radio. the third is a man who couldn’t stand up straight while receiving an award. i should be able to take them!“the infestation of bedbugs at the new york times office” @oann  was perhaps brought in by lightweight journalist bret stephens a conservative who does anything that his bosses at the paper tell him to do! he is now quitting twitter after being called a “bedbug.” tough guy!so interesting to read and see all of the free and interesting advice i am getting on china from people who have tried to handle it before and failed miserably - in fact they got taken to the cleaners. we are doing very well with china. this has never happened to them before!we are tracking closely tropical storm dorian as it heads as usual to puerto rico. fema and all others are ready  and will do a great job. when they do let them know it and give them a big thank you - not like last time. that includes from the incompetent mayor of san juan!would be very hard for jeremy corbyn the leader of britain’s labour party to seek a no-confidence vote against new prime minister boris johnson especially in light of the fact that boris is exactly what the u.k. has been looking for  will prove to be “a great one!” love u.k.just watched @foxnews heavily promoting the democrats through their dnc communications director spewing out whatever she wanted with zero pushback by anchor @sandrasmithfox. terrible considering that fox couldn’t even land a debate the dems give them nothing! @cnn  @msnbc........are all in for the open border socialists (or beyond). fox hires “give hillary the questions” @donnabrazile juan williams and low ratings shep smith. hopeless  clueless! they should go all the way left and i will still find a way to win - that’s what i do win. too bad!....our federal reserve cannot “mentally” keep up with the competition - other countries. at the g-7 in france all of the other leaders were giddy about how low their interest costs have gone. germany is actually “getting paid” to borrow money - zero interest plus! no clue fed!puerto rico is one of the most corrupt places on earth. their political system is broken and their politicians are either incompetent or corrupt. congress approved billions of dollars last time more than anyplace else has ever gotten and it is sent to crooked pols. no good!........and by the way i’m the best thing that’s ever happened to puerto rico!another totally fake story in the amazon washington post (lobbyist) which states that if my aides broke the law to build the wall (which is going up rapidly) i would give them a pardon. this was made up by the washington post only in order to demean and disparage - fake news!a sad day for the democrats kirsten gillibrand has dropped out of the presidential primary. i’m glad they never found out that she was the one i was really afraid of!the  amazon washington post and @cnn just did a fake interview on pardons for aids on the wall and that i didn’t think the wall on the southern border was that important to stop illegals wanting to come into our country. wrong vitally important. will make a big impact. so bad!there has never been a time in the history of our country that the media was so fraudulent fake or corrupt! when the “age of trump” is looked back on many years from now i only hope that a big part of my legacy will be the exposing of massive dishonesty in the fake news!puerto rico is in great shape with hurricane dorian taking a largely different route than anticipated. thank you to fema first responders and all for working so hard  being so well prepared. a great result! the bad news florida get ready! storm is building and will be big!hurricane dorian looks like it will be hitting florida late sunday night. be prepared and please follow state and federal instructions it will be a very big hurricane perhaps one of the biggest!crazy lawrence o’donnell who has been calling me wrong from even before i announced my run for the presidency even being previously forced by nbc to apologize which he did while crying for things he said about me  the apprentice was again forced to apologize this time.....the totally inaccurate reporting by lawrence o’donnell for which he has been forced by nbc to apologize is no different than the horrible corrupt and fraudulent fake news that i (and many millions of great supporters) have had to put up with for years. so bad for the usa!the economy is doing great with tremendous upside potential! if the fed would do what they should we are a rocket upward!the farmers are going to be so happy when they see what we are doing for ethanol not even including the e-15 year around which is already done. it will be a giant package get ready! at the same time i was able to save the small refineries from certain closing. great for all!perhaps never in the history of our country has someone been more thoroughly disgraced and excoriated than james comey in the just released inspector general’s report. he should be ashamed of himself!general motors which was once the giant of detroit is now one of the smallest auto manufacturers there. they moved major plants to china before i came into office. this was done despite the saving help given them by the usa. now they should start moving back to america again?the disastrous ig report on james comey shows in the strongest of terms how unfairly i and tens of millions of great people who support me were treated. our rights and liberties were illegally stripped away by this dishonest fool. we should be given our stolen time back?the fact that james comey was not prosecuted for the absolutely horrible things he did just shows how fair and reasonable attorney general bill barr is. so many people and experts that i have watched and read would have taken an entirely different course. comey got lucky!bryan dean wright former cia officer(dem): “in 2016 we had a coup. we have to take comey and others to task. makes no sense not to prosecute him. comey got a book deal. i fear for my country. he tried to kneecap our duly elected president and there are no consequences.” @foxfsthe euro is dropping against the dollar “like crazy” giving them a big export and manufacturing advantage...and the fed does nothing! our dollar is now the strongest in history. sounds good doesn’t it? except to those (manufacturers) that make product for sale outside the u.s.if the fed would cut we would have one of the biggest stock market increases in a long time. badly run and weak companies are smartly blaming these small tariffs instead of themselves for bad management...and who can really blame them for doing that? excuses!just arrived at camp david!“they could have charged comey with theft of government documents 641 of the criminal code because the ig found these were not his personal documents these were government documents.” @greggjarrett  “comey’s claim that these were just his own personal recollections would not......pass the laugh test and the inspector general just knocked that down.” @byronyork  @loudobbs“the ig found that james comey leaked classified documents to his attorneys which can be (is) a violation of the espionage act. this is consistent with all the lies that comey has been spreading. @greggjarrett  @byronyork @loudobbshas anyone noticed that the top shows on @foxnews and cable ratings are those that are fair (or great) to your favorite president me! congratulations to @seanhannity for being the number one shoe on cable television!while madeleine westerhout has a fully enforceable confidentiality agreement she is a very good person and i don’t think there would ever be reason to use it. she called me yesterday to apologize had a bad night. i fully understood and forgave her! i love tiffany doing great!...yes i am currently suing various people for violating their confidentiality agreements. disgusting and foul mouthed omarosa is one. i gave her every break despite the fact that she was despised by everyone and she went for some cheap money from a book. numerous others also!i was right about comey crooked cop!make america great again which is happening and then keep america great!looking like our great south carolina could get hit much harder than first thought. georgia and north carolina also. it’s moving around and very hard to predict except that it is one of the biggest and strongest (and really wide) that we have seen in decades. be safe!has anyone noticed that the top shows on @foxnews and cable ratings are those that are fair (or great) to your favorite president me! congratulations to @seanhannity for being the number one show on cable television!just watched congresswoman debbie dingell and many other democrats wanting to give up on our very successful trade battle with china which has had its worst economic year in memory (and getting worse). we are taking in $billions. will be big for farmers and all!being scolded by failed former “intelligence” officials like james clapper on my condolences to iran on their failed rocket launch. sadly for the united states guys like him comey and the even dumber john brennan don’t have a clue. they really set our country back........but now we are moving forward like never before. we are winning again and we are respected again!“the vindication belongs to the president for firing james comey. it was clearly the right thing to do. you don’t want an fbi director with jim comey’s ethics.” jason riley wall street journaljust briefed by attorney general barr about the shootings in texas. fbi and law enforcement is fully engaged. more to follow.peter morici economist: tariffs will not impact american consumers that much because the chinese currency has gone down which gives our importers a discount. importers can find suppliers outside of china. absolutely worth it we don’t want to be servants to the chinese! this.......is about american freedom. redirect the supply chain. there is no reason to buy everything from china!“james comey has been rebuked at the highest level with much more to come. an ig report doesn’t get any stronger calling him dangerous insubordinate. thank goodness that donald trump was elected because if he wasn’t elected these people would still be in power. two more.........reports are coming. comey very vulnerable. but where is the supreme court. where is justice roberts? if you lie to a court you should be held in contempt. so if you abused the fisa you must be held accountable. i hope justice roberts will take action.” jason chaffetz fox“comey and mccabe (and more) are dirty cops.” joe digenovai have not forgotten that when it was announced that i was going to do the apprentice and when it then became a big hit helping nbc’s failed lineup greatly @debramessing came up to me at an upfront  profusely thanked me even calling me “sir.” how times have changed!in addition to florida - south carolina north carolina georgia and alabama will most likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated. looking like one of the largest hurricanes ever. already category 5. be careful! god bless everyone!great job by texas law enforcement and first responders in handling the terrible shooting tragedy yesterday. thank you also to the fbi @gregabbott_tx and all others. a very tough and sad situation!pray for the people in the bahamas. being hit like never before category 5.  almost 200 mph winds.“we hold that legislative prayer is government speech not open to attack via those channels.” third circuit court of appeals. “lou that’s why this next election is so important the soul of america. they want to take religion out of american lives. thank god for judges like.........this (judge thomas ambro majotity opinion) and thank god for a president like donald j. trump who will appoint judges like this. he will soon have appointed 180 new federal judges not even including two great new supreme court justices.” @robertjeffress @loudobbs“when you put everything together the pro growth tax  regulation cuts help to retrain workers the tariffs which encourage manufacturers to come back to america along with president trumps tough approach on immigration (strong stance on illegals promoting merit based) it.......adds up to the most ambitious pro-worker policy agenda this country has ever seen. the president promised jobs jobs jobs and that is exactly what he is delivering.” @stevehiltonx @nextrevfnc @foxnewssince my election many trillions of dollars of worth has been created for our country and the stock market is up over 50%. if you followed the advice of the failing new york times columnist paul krugman you’d be doing very poorly - you’d be angry and hurt. he never got it!just watched afl-cio president richard trumka on @foxnews and thought to myself how different he is on tv than he is when he is with me at the white house. likes what we are doing until the cameras go on. we got robbed on trade and everything else while his dems just sat back........and watched. nafta is the worst trade deal ever made - terrible for labor - and richard let it stand. no wonder unions are losing so much. the workers will vote for me in 2020 (lowest unemployment most jobs ever) and should stop paying exorbitant $dues not worth it!“they are liars and in my opinion traitors!” @loudobbs talking about comey and his dwindling group of friends.“the last three years of trump policy have finally brought real hope and real change. unemployment this year hit a 50 year low. with president trump we’ve seen the lowest ever african american and hispanic unemployment. the booming trump economy has pushed up workers wages........average hourly wages growth has far outpaced what we saw with president obama. across all industries from mining and construction to leisure  hospitality with president trump we see income growth in states like iowa ohio pennsylvania wisconsin nevada florida..........swing states that went to trump in 2016 because he promised not to forget about them like the establishment had done for decades and their trust in president trump paid off as they saw their incomes rise...and it’s the lowest paid workers who have gained the most with........trump economics. with president trump tariffs are bringing companies back to the usa like he said they would! @stevehiltonxthe amazon washington post did a story that i brought racist attacks against the “squad.” no they brought racist attacks against our nation. all i do is call them out for the horrible things they have said. the democrats have become the party of the squad!the lamestream media has gone totally crazy! they write whatever they want seldom have sources (even though they say they do) never do “fact checking” anymore and are only looking for the “kill.” they take good news and make it bad. they are now beyond fake they are corrupt......the good news is that we are winning. our real opponent is not the democrats or the dwindling number of republicans that lost their way and got left behind our primary opponent is the fake news media. in the history of our country they have never been so bad!....trade agreement.” @business @chuckgrassley @joniernst  @debfisher @bensasse making great progress for our farmers. approved e-15 year round. big additional list to be submitted and approved within two weeks. will be even better for ethanol and we save our small refineries!such a phony hurricane report by lightweight reporter @jonathancarl of @abcworldnews. i suggested yesterday at fema that along with florida georgia south carolina and north carolina even alabama could possibly come into play which was true. they made a big deal about this.......when in fact under certain original scenarios it was in fact correct that alabama could have received some “hurt.” always good to be prepared! but the fake news is only interested in demeaning and belittling. didn’t play my whole sentence or statement. bad people!such a phony hurricane report by lightweight reporter @jonkarl of

negotiations with china. while i am sure they would love to be dealing with a new administration so they could continue their practice of “ripoff usa”($600 b/year)16 months plus is a long time to be hemorrhaging jobs and companies on a long-shot........and then think what happens to china when i win. deal would get much tougher! in the meantime china’s supply chain will crumble and businesses jobs and money will be gone!for all of the “geniuses” out there many who have been in other administrations and “taken to the cleaners” by china that want me to get together with the eu and others to go after china trade practices remember the eu  all treat us very unfairly on trade also. will change!germany and so many other countries have negative interest rates “they get paid for loaning money” and our federal reserve fails to act! remember these are also our weak currency competitors!the incompetent mayor of london sadique kahn was bothered that i played a very fast round of golf yesterday. many pols exercise for hours or travel for weeks. me i run through one of my courses (very inexpensive). president obama would fly to hawaii. kahn should focus on........”knife crime” which is totally out of control in london. people are afraid to even walk the streets. he is a terrible mayor who should stay out of our business!the incompetent mayor of london sadiq khan was bothered that i played a

a little bit lucky with respect to hurricane dorian but please don’t let down your guard. as it heads up the coast lots of very bad and unpredictable things can happen! on the other hand the bahamas have been devastated. we are sending crews to help!the truth is that we have a nation that is disgusted with the fbi. we have a crisis of confidence in the number one law enforcement agency in this country (thanks comey!). @loudobbs “it’s a scandal.” @alandersh“i am so tired of hearing the rationalization of the left in the country because they hate donald trump. inexplicably and without foundation they choose to hate america. the democrats have truly become the party of hate.” @loudobbs“to declassify is so important because if this were a democrat president or a democrat candidate that was spied on the way president trump was spied on this would be a scandal that would make watergate look like nothing. illegal spying.....“the chinese are very adept at not accepting anything. you’ve got to be very tough and that’s what trump is doing. it’s in china’s interest to correct and i think we’ll end up with a solution that’s dramatically better than we have today. frankly i think the impact of what........trump is doing to china is not lost on the rest of the world. europe has had among the most protectionist policies forever. they’re sitting there and saying gee are we next? maybe you are! we’ve got to change the rules. the u.s. can’t defend the world and pay for it............we can’t have a system where we run our entire economy for the benefit of other countries which

the world\\'s cleanest and safest air and water? america!6. the democrats’ destructive “environmental” proposals will raise your energy bill and prices at the pump. don\\'t the democrats care about fighting american poverty?7. the badly flawed paris climate agreement protects the polluters hurts americans and cost a fortune. not on my watch!8. i want crystal clean water and the cleanest and the purest air on the planet – we’ve now got that!“absolutely nothing is more important than going back  getting to the bottom of the origins of the investigation. we had an administration using america’s spying apparatus to spy on a political opponent at the height of a presidential election. those are all known undisputed.......facts and that should terrify every american regardless of their political stripe. the idea that all of that information hasn’t already been revealed shows how dastardly these people are and how terrified they are about what’s going to happen when that........information does come out.” charlie hurt washington times  @loudobbsin the early days of the hurricane when it was predicted that dorian would go through miami or west palm beach even before it reached the bahamas certain models strongly suggested that alabama  georgia would be hit as it made its way through florida  to the gulf........instead it turned north and went up the coast where it continues now. in the one model through florida the great state of alabama would have been hit or grazed. in the path it took no. read my full fema statement. what i said was accurate! all fake news in order to demean!bad “actress” debra the mess messing is in hot water. she wants to create a “blacklist” of trump supporters  is being accused of mccarthyism. is also being accused of being a racist because of the terrible things she said about blacks and mental illness. if roseanne barr........said what she did even being on a much higher rated show she would have been thrown off television. will fake news nbc allow a mccarthy style racist to continue? abc fired roseanne. watch the double standard!alabama was going to be hit or grazed and then hurricane dorian took a different path (up along the east coast). the fake news knows this very well. that’s why they’re the fake news!really good jobs numbers!after almost 3 years in my administration jason greenblatt will be leaving to pursue work in the private sector. jason has been a loyal and great friend and fantastic lawyer........his dedication to israel and to seeking peace between israel and the palestinians won’t be forgotten. he will be missed. thank you jason!just talked to governor roy cooper of north carolina as hurricane dorian ominously comes up the east coast. we are monitoring it at the @whitehouse ready to assist via our great team over at @fema who are already on site. we are with you all the way north carolina. be safe!just spoke to governor @henrymcmaster of south carolina regarding hurricane dorian. i informed henry that we are monitoring south carolina and stand by ready to assist. be safe everyone we are totally with you!just got off the phone with governor brian kemp (@govkemp) of georgia. happy to hear that things are looking good for everyone. i stand by ready to assist along with our great team at @fema – we’re with you all the way!great job done by @govrondesantis @senrickscott senator @marcorubio and all of the those from florida that were so brilliantly involved including @fema @uscg law enforcement and first responders. thank you all!looking forward to watching @sarahhuckabee sanders tomorrow morning on @foxandfriends by far the #1 rated show on morning cable at 8:30am. sarah will be an incredible addition to @foxnews!“i think president trump is set in his ways because he doesn’t see any weakening. i mean look at the joblessness report today. what i’m surprised at is how strong the consumer is. i think the chinese need it (a deal) more than we do. it’s statistical. i just think........that our economy is very strong. if the fed would lower rates to where the bond market says they should be then i really wouldn’t worry about a recession.” @jimcramer @joesquawkthe immigration law institute’s christopher hajec says “the supreme court has to look st whether daca is lawful. what they are looking at now is whether trump’s recision of daca is lawful. must consider lawfulness of daca itself. looks very odd that president trump doesn’t.........have the discretion to end the program that president obama began in his discretion. that program was unlawful to begin with. i think it’s very unlikely that the scotus is going to issue an order reinstating what it believes is an unlawful program. daca is unlawful.” .........president obama never had the legal right to sign daca and he indicated so at the time of signing. but in any event how can he have the right to sign and i don’t have the right to “unsigned.” totally illegal document which would actually give the president new powers.daca will be going before the supreme court. it is a document that even president obama didn’t feel he had the legal right to sign - he signed it anyway! rest assured that if the sc does what all say it must based on the law a bipartisan deal will be made to the benefit of all!i agree with @jimcramer the fed should lower rates. they were way too early to raise and way too late to cut - and big dose quantitative tightening didn’t exactly help either. where did i find this guy jerome? oh well you can’t win them all!congratulations to @edhenry and his sister on a great success. what a wonderful thing to do!great interview of sarah sanders by @foxandfriends. she is a terrific person with a great future!our great @judgejeanine has just written a book that will add to the tremendous success of her last number one best seller. it’s called “radicals resistance and revenge the left’s plot to remake america.” it is a fantastic book. go get it! @foxandfriendslarry kudlow on @varneyco now!the fake news media was fixated on the fact that i properly said at the beginnings of hurricane dorian that in addition to florida  other states alabama may also be grazed or hit. they went crazy hoping against hope that i made a mistake (which i didn’t). check out maps.........this nonsense has never happened to another president. four days of corrupt reporting still without an apology. but there are many things that the fake news media has not apologized to me for like the witch hunt or spygate! the lamestream media and their democrat.........partner should start playing it straight. it would be so much better for our country!great job by fema law enforcement first responders u.s. coast guard and all! keep going we all appreciate what you are doing!“china is eating the tariffs.” billions pouring into usa. targeted patriot farmers getting massive dollars from the incoming tariffs! good jobs numbers no inflation(fed). china having worst year in decades. talks happening good for all!the @uscg @fema and all others along with other countries that have been helping have been asked to move people in the badly hit sections of the bahamas to other sections of the bahamas........that were not hit – and that are in good condition. any cruise ship companies willing to act as stationary housing etc. i am sure would be appreciated!china just enacted a major stimulus plan. with all the tariffs they are paying to the usa billions and billions of dollars they need it! in the meantime our federal reserve sits back and does nothing!thank you to bahamian prime minister hubert minnis for your very gracious and kind words in saying that without the help of the united states and me their would have been many more casualties. i give all credit to fema the u.s. coast guard  the brave people of the bahamas......i would also like to thank “papa” doug manchester hopefully the next ambassador to the bahamas for the incredible amount of time money and passion he has spent on helping to bring safety to the bahamas. much work to be done by the bahamian government. we will help! @oanni want to congratulate @senatemajldr mitch mcconnell and all republicans. today i signed the 160th federal judge to the bench. within a short period of time we will be at over 200 federal judges including many in the appellate courts  two great new u.s. supreme court justices!“in 22 years of patrolling our southern border i have never seen mexico act like a true border security partner until president trump got involved and now they are stepping up to the plate and doing what they need to do.” brandon judd national border patrolrussia and ukraine just swapped large numbers of prisoners. very good news perhaps a first giant step to peace. congratulations to both countries!the failing new york times stated in an article written by obama flunky peter baker (who lovingly wrote obama book)”even after the president forecast the storm to include alabama.” this is not true. i said very early on that it may even hit alabama. a big difference........fake news. i would like very much to stop referring to this ridiculous story but the lamestream media just won’t let it alone. they always have to have the last word even though they know they are defrauding  deceiving the public. the public knows that the media is corrupt!unbeknownst to almost everyone the major taliban leaders and separately the president of afghanistan were going to secretly meet with me at camp david on sunday. they were coming to the united states tonight. unfortunately in order to build false leverage they admitted to......an attack in kabul that killed one of our great great soldiers and 11 other people. i immediately cancelled the meeting and called off peace negotiations. what kind of people would kill so many in order to seemingly strengthen their bargaining position? they didn’t they........only made it worse! if they cannot agree to a ceasefire during these very important peace talks and would even kill 12 innocent people then they probably don’t have the power to negotiate a meaningful agreement anyway. how many more decades are they willing to fight?looking forward to being in the north carolina tomorrow night. we’re having a big rally for a great guy dan bishop. strong on crime borders your military and our vets we need dan bishop in washington badly. his opponent is weak on crime borders and against your 2nd a.congratulations to @judgejeanine pirro on having again the number one best selling book!when all of the people pushing so hard for criminal justice reform were  unable to come even close to getting it done they came to me as a group and asked for my help. i got it done with a group of senators  others who would never have gone for it. obama couldn’t come close........a man named @vanjones68 and many others were profusely grateful (at that time!). i signed it into law no one else did  republicans deserve much credit. but now that it is passed people that had virtually nothing to do with it are taking the praise. guys like boring.........musician @johnlegend and his filthy mouthed wife are talking now about how great it is - but i didn’t see them around when we needed help getting it passed. “anchor”@lesterholtnbc doesn’t even bring up the subject of president trump or the republicans when talking about.........the importance or passage of criminal justice reform. they only talk about the minor players or people that had nothing to do with it...and the people that so desperately sought my help when everyone else had failed all they talk about now is impeaching president trump!when the former governor of the great state of south carolina @marksanford was reported missing only to then say he was away hiking on the appalachian trail then was found in argentina with his flaming dancer friend it sounded like his political career was over. it was.......but then he ran for congress and won only to lose his re-elect after i tweeted my endorsement on election day for his opponent. but now take heart he is back and running for president of the united states. the three stooges all badly failed candidates will give it a go!94% approval rating in the republican party a record. thank you!great news that an activist investor is now involved with att. as the owner of very low ratings @cnn perhaps they will now put a stop to all of the fake news emanating from its non-credible “anchors.” also i hear that because of its bad ratings it is losing a fortune........but most importantly @cnn is bad for the usa. their international division spews bad information  fake news all over the globe. this is why foreign leaders are always asking me “why does the media hate the u.s. sooo much?” it is a fraudulent shame  all comes from the top!as bad as @cnn is comcast msnbc is worse. their ratings are also way down because they have lost all credibility. i believe their stories about me are not 93% negative but actually 100% negative. they are incapable of saying anything positive despite all of the great things.....that this administration has done. they don’t talk about the great economy the big tax and regulation cuts the rebuilding of the military “choice” at our va our vets judges and supreme court justices the border wall going up lowest crime numbers 2nd a and so much more!the trump administrations has achieved more in the first 2 1/2 years of its existence than perhaps any administration in the history of our country. we get zero media credit for what we have done and are doing but the people know and that’s all that is important!i know nothing about an air force plane landing at an airport (which i do not own and have nothing to do with) near turnberry resort (which i do own) in scotland and filling up with fuel with the crew staying overnight at turnberry (they have good taste!). nothing to do with mei had nothing to do with the decision of our great @vp mike pence to stay overnight at one of the trump owned resorts in doonbeg ireland. mike’s family has lived in doonbeg for many years and he thought that during his very busy european visit he would stop and see his family!the trump administration has achieved more in the first 2 1/2 years of its existence than perhaps any administration in the history of our country. we get zero media credit for what we have done and are doing but the people know and that’s all that is important!a lot of fake news is being reported that i overruled the vp and various advisers on a potential camp david meeting with the taliban. this story is false! i always think it is good to meet and talk but in this case i decided not to. the dishonest media likes to create......the look of turmoil in the white house of which there is none. i view much of the media as simply an arm of the democrat party. they are corrupt and they are extremely upset at how well our country is doing under my leadership including......the economy where there is no recession much to the regret of the lamestream media! they are working overtime to help the democrats win in 2020 but that will never happen americans are too smart!we have been serving as policemen in afghanistan and that was not meant to be the job of our great soldiers the finest on earth. over the last four days we have been hitting our enemy harder than at any time in the last ten years!abc/washington post poll was the worst and most inaccurate poll of any taken prior to the 2016 election. when my lawyers protested they took a 12 point down and brought it to almost even by election day. it was a fake poll by two very bad and dangerous media outlets. sad!one of the greatest and most powerful weapons used by the fake and corrupt news media is the phony polling information they put out. many of these polls are fixed or worked in such a way that a certain candidate will look good or bad. internal polling looks great the best ever!i informed john bolton last night that his services are no longer needed at the white house. i disagreed strongly with many of his suggestions as did others in the administration and therefore........i asked john for his resignation which was given to me this morning. i thank john very much for his service. i will be naming a new national security advisor next week.one down one to go – greg murphy is projected to win in the great state of north carolina! #nc03excellent interview by @condoleezzarice on @marthamaccallum on @foxnews. very interesting and secure perspective on life.senator ben sasse has done a wonderful job representing the people of nebraska. he is great with our vets the military and your very important second amendment. strong on crime and the border ben has my complete and total endorsement!dan bishop was down 17 points 3 weeks ago. he then asked me for help we changed his strategy together and he ran a great race. big rally last night. now it looks like he is going to win. @cnn  @msnbc are moving their big studio equipment and to talent out. stay tuned!dan bishop was down 17 points 3 weeks ago. he then asked me for help we changed his strategy together and he ran a great race. big rally last night. now it looks like he is going to win. @cnn  @msnbc are moving their big studio equipment and talent out. stay tuned!greg murphy is a big winner in north carolina 03. much bigger margins than originally anticipated. congratulations greg!big night for the republican party. congratulations to all!.@cnn  @msnbc were all set to have a big victory until dan bishop won north carolina 09. now you will hear them barely talk about or cover the race. fake news never wins!alice @alicetweet stewart: thank you for the nice words while on @cnn concerning the two big republican congressional victories. you’d be great on a network with much higher ratings. keep up the good work!greg murphy won big 62% to 37% in north carolina 03  the fake news barely covered the race. the win was far bigger than anticipated - there was just nothing the fakers could say to diminish or demean the scope of this victory. so we had two big victories tonight greg  dan!“china suspends tariffs on some u.s. products. being hit very hard supply chains breaking up as many companies move or look to move to other countries. much more expensive to china than originally thought.” @cnbc  @joesquawkthe federal reserve should get our interest rates down to zero or less and we should then start to refinance our debt. interest cost could be brought way down while at the same time substantially lengthening the term. we have the great currency power and balance sheet.........the usa should always be paying the the lowest rate. no inflation! it is only the naïveté of jay powell and the federal reserve that doesn’t allow us to do what other countries are already doing. a once in a lifetime opportunity that we are missing because of “boneheads.”in a hypothetical poll done by one of the worst pollsters of them all the amazon washington post/abc which predicted i would lose to crooked hillary by 15 points (how did that work out?) sleepy joe pocahontas and virtually all others would beat me in the general election........this is a phony suppression poll meant to build up their democrat partners. i haven’t even started campaigning yet and am constantly fighting fake news like russia russia russia. look at north carolina last night. dan bishop down big in the polls wins. easier than 2016!if it weren’t for the never ending fake news about me and with all that i have done (more than any other president in the first 2 1/2 years!) i would be leading the “partners” of the lamestream media by 20 points. sorry but true!at the request of the vice premier of china liu he and due to the fact that the people\\'s republic of china will be celebrating their 70th anniversary........on october 1st we have agreed as a gesture of good will to move the increased tariffs on 250 billion dollars worth of goods (25% to 30%) from october 1st to october 15th.i had an excellent telephone conversation with andrés manuel lópez obrador president of mexico talking about southern border security and various other things of mutual interest for the people of our respective countries........the southern border is becoming very strong despite the obstruction by democrats not agreeing to do anything on loopholes or asylum!european central bank acting quickly cuts rates 10 basis points. they are trying and succeeding in depreciating the euro against the very strong dollar hurting u.s. exports.... and the fed sits and sits and sits. they get paid to borrow money while we are paying interest!it is expected that china will be buying large amounts of our agricultural products!some really big court wins on the border lately!“dems have never gotten over the fact that president trump won the election!” @gopleader mccarthy“we can’t beat him so lets impeach him!” democrat rep. al green“this should have been over with after the mueller report came out.” @guypbenson @foxnewshow do you impeach a president who has helped create perhaps the greatest economy in the history of our country? all time best unemployment numbers especially for blacks hispanics asians  women. more people working today than ever before. rebuilt military  choice for vets.......ig report which showed him to be a disgraced  dirty cop. republicans have unified like never before. you don’t impeach presidents for doing a good (great!) job. no obstruction no collusion only treasonous crimes committed by the other side and led by the democrats. sad!illegal immigration costs the usa over 300 billion dollars a year. there is no reason for this and things are being set in motion to have this number come way down. democrats could end loopholes and it would be a whole lot easier and faster. but it will all happen anyway!........very stupidly negotiated trade deals and illegal immigration are a tremendous cost and burden to our country. they are both coming along very well and someday in the not too distant future america will see a very positive change. remember america first!while i like the vaping alternative to cigarettes we need to make sure this alternative is safe for all! let’s get counterfeits off the market and keep young children from vaping!“a very stable genius!” thank you.who the hell is joy-ann reid? never met her she knows zero about me has no talent and truly doesn’t have the “it” factor needed for success in showbiz. had a bad reputation and now works for the comcast/nbc losers making up phony stories about me. low ratings. fake news!94% approval rating in the republican party! tuesday night in the great state of north carolina proved that high and very beautiful number correct.make america great again!keep america great!i had a call today with prime minister netanyahu to discuss the possibility of moving forward with a mutual defense treaty between the united states and israel that would further anchor the tremendous alliance........between our two countries. i look forward to continuing those discussions after the israeli elections when we meet at the united nations later this month!the taliban has never been hit harder than it is being hit right now. killing 12 people including one great american soldier was not a good idea. there are much better ways to set up a negotiation. the taliban knows they made a big mistake and they have no idea how to recover!now the radical left democrats and their partner the lamestream media are after brett kavanaugh again talking loudly of their favorite word impeachment. he is an innocent man who has been treated horribly. such lies about him. they want to scare him into turning liberal!brett kavanaugh should start suing people for liable or the justice department should come to his rescue. the lies being told about him are unbelievable. false accusations without recrimination. when does it stop? they are trying to influence his opinions. can’t let that happen!brett kavanaugh should start suing people for libel or the justice department should come to his rescue. the lies being told about him are unbelievable. false accusations without recrimination. when does it stop? they are trying to influence his opinions. can’t let that happen!can’t let brett kavanaugh give radical left democrat (liberal plus) opinions based on threats of impeaching him over made up stories (sound familiar?) false allegations and lies. this is the game they play. fake and corrupt news is working overtime! #protectkavanaughcan’t believe the @washingtonpost wrote a positive front page story “unity issue has parties pointing to trump. gop goes all in while democrats clash over ideology  tactics. mr. president we are with you the entire way. republicans have....coalesced around trump.”.........then on top of it all kathleen parker of all people wrote “in case you were wondering trump won the debate.” true but what is going on at the @washingtonpost? not fake news!based on the attack on saudi arabia which may have an impact on oil prices i have authorized the release of oil from the strategic petroleum reserve if needed in a to-be-determined amount........sufficient to keep the markets well-supplied. i have also informed all appropriate agencies to expedite approvals of the oil pipelines currently in the permitting process in texas and various other states.saudi arabia oil supply was attacked. there is reason to believe that we know the culprit are locked and loaded depending on verification but are waiting to hear from the kingdom as to who they believe was the cause of this attack and under what terms we would proceed!plenty of oil!here we go again with general motors and the united auto workers. get together and make a deal!the fake news is saying that i am willing to meet with iran “no conditions.” that is an incorrect statement (as usual!).“we cannot have what happened to this president happen again.” joe digenova.  “it is time for justice to come barreling in.” @loudobbs  can you imagine that with everything going on in this world the witch hunt though on a respirator is still whimpering along. a disgrace!house judiciary has given up on the mueller report sadly for them after two years and $40000000 spent - zero collusion zero obstruction. so they say ok lets look at everything else and all of the deals that “trump” has done over his lifetime. but it doesn’t........work that way. i have a better idea. look at the obama book deal or the ridiculous netflix deal. then look at all the deals made by the dems in congress the “congressional slush fund” and lastly the ig reports. take a look at them. those investigations would be over fast!the @nytimes. “this week the senate passed a milestone in confirming the 150th federal judge of mr. trump’s administration to a lifetime appointment far outstripping barack obama’s pace and fulfilling pledges by mr. trump and mr. o’connell to remake the federal judiciary.........’these conservative judicial appointments will impact our nation for years to come’ said lindsey graham republican of south carolina who leads the judiciary committee and who has been speeding through trump nominees.” the entire court system is changing at a record pace!because we have done so well with energy over the last few years (thank you mr. president!) we are a net energy exporter  now the number one energy producer in the world. we don’t need middle eastern oil  gas  in fact have very few tankers there but will help our allies!producer prices in china shrank most in 3 years due to china’s big devaluation of their currency coupled with monetary stimulus. federal reserve not watching? will fed ever get into the game? dollar strongest ever! really bad for exports. no inflation...highest interest rates......the united states because of the federal reserve is paying a much higher interest rate than other competing countries. they can’t believe how lucky they are that jay powell  the fed don’t have a clue. and now on top of it all the oil hit. big interest rate drop stimulus!“the new york times walks back report on kavanaugh assault claim.” @foxandfriends  the one who is actually being assaulted is justice kavanaugh - assaulted by lies and fake news! this is all about the lamestream media working with their partner the dems.“what’s happening to justice kavanaugh is a disgrace. this guy is not a good man he is a great man. he has to go to his church with his family while these terrible reports are being written about him a disgrace!” dan bongino @foxandfriendsjust out: “kavanaugh accuser doesn’t recall incident.” @foxandfriends  do you believe what these horrible people will do or say. they are looking to destroy and influence his opinions - but played the game badly. they should be sued!remember when iran shot down a drone saying knowingly that it was in their “airspace” when in fact it was nowhere close. they stuck strongly to that story knowing that it was a very big lie. now they say that they had nothing to do with the attack on saudi arabia. we’ll see?“democrats would rather talk about gun control than get something done.” governor john sununu @foxnews @billhemmer the big questions are will they “move the goalposts” and is this just a ploy to take your guns away? i hope not on both counts but i’ll be able to figure it out!they failed on the mueller report they failed on robert mueller’s testimony they failed on everything else so now the democrats are trying to build a case that i enrich myself by being president. good idea except i will and have always expected to lose billions of dollars......for the privilege of being your president - and doing the best job that has been done in many decades. i am far beyond somebody paying for a hotel room for the evening or filling up a gas tank at an airport i do not own. these radical left democrats are crazy! obama netflix?in a short while i will be presenting the new york @yankees @marianorivera the greatest relief pitcher (closer!) of all time with the presidential medal of freedom in the east room of the @whitehouse!i call for the resignation of everybody at the new york times involved in the kavanaugh smear story and while you’re at it the russian witch hunt hoax which is just as phony! they’ve taken the old grey lady and broken her down destroyed her virtue and ruined her reputation......she can never recover and will never return to greatness under current management. the times is dead long live the new york times!....”that story (kavanaugh) is nowhere near the standard that should be met in publishing a story.” @brithume @foxnewsthe new york times is now blaming an editor for the horrible mistake they made in trying to destroy or influence justice brett kavanaugh. it wasn’t the editor the times knew everything. they are sick and desperate losing in so many ways!as corey lewandowski stated very clearly yesterday in front of the house judiciary committee president trump didn’t do anything wrong or illegal. but they all know that. the democrats are hurting our country and getting nothing done. shameful! @clewandowski_  @foxandfriendsterrence k. williams “you can’t impeach trump for being a winner!”so nice that our country is now energy independent. the usa is in better shape than ever before. strongest military by far biggest economy (no longer even close) number one in energy! maga = kag!i have just instructed the secretary of the treasury to substantially increase sanctions on the country of iran!i am pleased to announce that i will name robert c. o’brien currently serving as the very successful special presidential envoy for hostage affairs at the state department as our new national security advisor. i have worked long  hard with robert. he will do a great job!the trump administration is revoking california’s federal waiver on emissions in order to produce far less expensive cars for the consumer while at the same time making the cars substantially safer. this will lead to more production because of this pricing and safety.......... advantage and also due to the fact that older highly polluting cars will be replaced by new extremely environmentally friendly cars. there will be very little difference in emissions between the california standard and the new u.s. standard but the cars will be........far safer and much less expensive. many more cars will be produced under the new and uniform standard meaning significantly more jobs jobs jobs! automakers should seize this opportunity because without this alternative to california you will be out of business.jay powell and the federal reserve fail again. no “guts” no sense no vision!  a terrible communicator!all polls and some brand new polls show very little support for impeachment. such a waste of time especially with sooo much good that could be done including prescription drug price reduction healthcare infrastructure etc.another fake news story out there - it never ends! virtually anytime i speak on the phone to a foreign leader i understand that there may be many people listening from various u.s. agencies not to mention those from the other country itself. no problem!....knowing all of this is anybody dumb enough to believe that i would say something inappropriate with a foreign leader while on such a potentially “heavily populated” call. i would only do what is right anyway and only do good for the usa!presidential harassment!because of my administration drug prices are down for the first time in almost 50 years — but the american people need congress to help. i like sen. grassley’s drug pricing bill very much and it’s great to see speaker pelosi’s bill today. let’s get it done in a bipartisan way!great news. @mariabartiromo just renewed her deal with fox. i don’t care how much they paid her they got a beautiful bargain. congratulations to both!the radical left democrats and their fake news media partners headed up again by little adam schiff and batting zero for 21 against me are at it again! they think i may have had a “dicey” conversation with a certain foreign leader based on a “highly partisan” whistleblowers......statement. strange that with so many other people hearing or knowing of the perfectly fine and respectful conversation that they would not have also come forward. do you know the reason why they did not? because there was nothing said wrong it was pitch perfect!the fake news media and their partner the democrat party want to stay as far away as possible from the joe biden demand that the ukrainian government fire a prosecutor who was investigating his son or they won’t get a very large amount of u.s. money so they fabricate a.........story about me and a perfectly fine and routine conversation i had with the new president of the ukraine. nothing was said that was in any way wrong but biden’s demand on the other hand was a complete and total disaster. the fake news knows this but doesn’t want to report!now that the democrats and the fake news media have gone “bust” on every other of their witch hunt schemes they are trying to start one just as ridiculous as the others call it the ukraine witch hunt while at the same time trying to protect sleepy joe biden. will fail again!some of the best economic numbers our country has ever experienced are happening right now. this is despite a crooked and demented deep state and a probably illegal democrat/fake news media partnership the likes of which the world has never seen. make america great again!“they’re trying to turn what was a biden scandal into a trump scandal.” @peterscheeizer the problem is “trump” did nothing wrong!“the pretend ukraine scandal is an another malicious seditious effort to protect the obama/clinton gang. criminal classified leaks and spying targeting trump — again.” @tomfitton“it appears that an american spy in one of our intelligence agencies may have been spying on our own president. the complaint suggests that this intel agent was listening in on trump’s conversation........with a foreign leader. was this person officially asked to listen to the conversation or was he or she secretly listening in?” @greggjarrett“they’re trying to turn what was a biden scandal into a trump scandal.” @peterschweizer the problem is “trump” did nothing wrong!“ukraine foreign minister disputes reports of any pressure from trump. this conversation was long friendly and it touched on many questions.” @nbcnews  correct. if your looking for something done wrong just look at the tape of sleepy joe. he is being protected by the media!the lamestream media had a very bad week. they pushed numerous phony stories and got caught especially the failing new york times which has lost more money over the last 10 years than any paper in history and the amazon washington post. they are the enemy of the people!...the fake news media nowadays not only doesn’t check for the accuracy of the facts they knowingly make up the facts. they even make up sources in order to protect their partners the democrats. it is so wrong but they don’t even care anymore. they have gone totally crazy!!!!“when someone gets nominated overwhelmingly and then wins the election as he did then he gets to set the national agenda. the press is just outrages. this @nytimes story is the most irresponsible thing i’ve ever seen.” @edrollins @loudobbs  i agree. they also lose too much!“the real story involves hunter biden going around the world and collecting large payments from foreign governments and foreign oligarchs.” peter schweizer  laura ingraham hunter made a fortune in ukraine and in china. he knew nothing about energy or anything else.“go across the world and you’ll see either very low interest rates or negative rates. the president wants to be competitive with these other countries on this but i don’t think he’ll fire jay powell (even if i should!).” we should always be paying less interest than others!“they are trying to destroy and influence justice kavanaugh a very good man.” @lindseygrahamsc  100% correct and they should be fully exposed for what they are!“the @nytimes is trying to make someone (justice kavanaugh) into an evil person when they don’t have the information to back it up. it is a false hoax.” @mzhemingway @mediabuzzfnc  zero people were fired at the times. why?justice kavanaugh should sue the failing new york times for all they are worth!now the fake news media says i “pressured the ukrainian president at least 8 times during my telephone call with him.” this supposedly comes from a so-called “whistleblower” who they say doesn’t even have a first hand account of what was said. more democrat/crooked media con.......breaking news: the ukrainian government just said they weren’t pressured at all during the “nice” call. sleepy joe biden on the other hand forced a tough prosecutor out from investigating his son’s company by threat of not giving big dollars to ukraine. that’s the real story!just leaving the great state of ohio for new york and a few big days at the united nations. your country will be well represented!“the very thing that they are accusing president trump of doing (which i didn’t do) was actually done by joe biden. continues to be a double standard.” @repdevinnunes  @foxandfriends  these people are stone cold crooked. also who is this so-called “whistleblower” who doesn’t.......know the correct facts. is he on our country’s side. where does he come from. is this all about schiff  the democrats again after years of being wrong?94% approval rating in the republican party. thank you!“@foxnews bombshell information reports that the so-called whistleblower did not have firsthand knowledge of that phone conversation with ukraine’s president.” wow! @harrisfaulkner it is all a democrat/adam schiff scam! doing this for 3 years now and found nothing!i am currently at the united nations representing our country but have authorized the release tomorrow of the complete fully declassified and unredacted transcript of my phone conversation with president zelensky of ukraine........you will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call. no pressure and unlike joe biden and his son no quid pro quo! this is nothing more than a continuation of the greatest and most destructive witch hunt of all time!the democrats are so focused on hurting the republican party and the president that they are unable to get anything done because of it including legislation on gun safety lowering of prescription drug prices infrastructure etc. so bad for our country!such an important day at the united nations so much work and so much success and the democrats purposely had to ruin and demean it with more breaking news witch hunt garbage. so bad for our country!pelosi nadler schiff and of course maxine waters! can you believe this?they never even saw the transcript of the call. a total witch hunt!presidential harassment!secretary of state pompeo recieved permission from ukraine government to release the transcript of the telephone call i had with their president. they don’t know either what the big deal is. a total witch hunt scam by the democrats!great new book by the brilliant andrew mccarthy ball of collusion the plot to rig an election and destroy a presidency. get it and some other great new books which i will soon be recommending. they tell you about the crooked pols and the witch hunt that has now been exposed!there has been no president in the history of our country who has been treated so badly as i have. the democrats are frozen with hatred and fear. they get nothing done. this should never be allowed to happen to another president. witch hunt!“the democrats have been talking about impeaching donald trump since before he was inaugurated.” @stevedoocy  @foxandfriends  and for no reason other than the great success we are having with the economy the military vets tax and regulation cuts healthcare and so much more!will the democrats apologize after seeing what was said on the call with the ukrainian president? they should a perfect call - got them by surprise!wow! “ukraine whistleblower’s lead attorney donated to biden.” @freebeaconi have informed @gopleader kevin mccarthy and all republicans in the house that i fully support transparency on so-called whistleblower information but also insist on transparency from joe biden and his son hunter on the millions of dollars that have been quickly and easily........taken out of ukraine and china. additionally i demand transparency from democrats that went to ukraine and attempted to force the new president to do things that they wanted under the form of political threat.the greatest scam in the history of american politics!the democrats are trying to destroy the republican party and all that it stands for. stick together play their game and fight hard republicans. our country is at stake!“is their a case for impeachment? absolutely not!” there is no high crimes or misdemeanors no treason no extortion no treason.” rd robert ray respected“is there a case for impeachment? absolutely not! there is no high crime or misdemeanor no crime no extortion no treason.” robert ray  @foxnewsa whistleblower with second hand information? another fake news story! see what was said on the very nice no pressure call. another witch hunt!liddle’ adam schiff who has worked unsuccessfully for 3 years to hurt the republican party and president has just said that the whistleblower even though he or she only had second hand information “is credible.” how can that be with zero info and a known bias. democrat scam!congratulations to my friend @senshelby our powerful appropriations chairman for his hard work on many strong bills that continue to rebuild our military invest in border security and many other priorities. good work and keep fighting you are winning!no one has done more behind the scenes for strong border security than @sencapito. her bill passed committee today with $5b for the border wall. west virginia is a great state and shelley gets it done. keep it up!will be a great and very accurate show tonight by @seanhannity on @foxnews (9:00 pm). will play my full statement from air force one!to show you how dishonest the lamestream media is i used the word liddle’ not liddle in discribing corrupt congressman liddle’ adam schiff. low ratings @cnn purposely took the hyphen out and said i spelled the word little wrong. a small but never ending situation with cnn!obama loving (wrote obama book) peter baker of the failing new york times married to an even bigger trump hater than himself should not even be allowed to write about me. every story is a made up disaster with sources and leakers that don’t even exist. i had a simple and very.......nice call with with the new president of ukraine it could not have been better or more honorable and the fake news media and democrats working as a team have fraudulently made it look bad. it wasn’t bad it was very legal and very good. a continuing witch hunt!rep. adam schiff fraudulently read to congress with millions of people watching a version of my conversation with the president of ukraine that doesn’t exist. he was supposedly reading the exact transcribed version of the call but he completely changed the words to make it........sound horrible an me sound guilty. he was desperate and he got caught. adam schiff therefore lied to congress and attempted to defraud the american public. he has been doing this for two years. i am calling for him to immediately resign from congress based on this fraud!rep. adam schiff fraudulently read to congress with millions of people watching a version of my conversation with the president of ukraine that doesn’t exist. he was supposedly reading the exact transcribed version of the call but he completely changed the words to make it......sound horrible and me sound guilty. he was desperate and he got caught. adam schiff therefore lied to congress and attempted to defraud the american public. he has been doing this for two years. i am calling for him to immediately resign from congress based on this fraud!iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on them in order to meet. i said of course no!rep. adam schiff totally made up my conversation with ukraine president and read it to congress and millions. he must resign and be investigated. he has been doing this for two years. he is a sick man!sounding more and more like the so-called whistleblower isn’t a whistleblower at all. in addition all second hand information that proved to be so inaccurate that there may not have even been somebody else a leaker or spy feeding it to him or her? a partisan operative?if that perfect phone call with the president of ukraine isn’t considered appropriate then no future president can ever again speak to another foreign leader!can you imagine if these do nothing democrat savages people like nadler schiff aoc plus 3 and many more had a republican party who would have done to obama what the do nothings are doing to me. oh well maybe next time!presidential harassment!make america great again!keep america great!how do you impeach a president who has created the greatest economy in the history of our country entirely rebuilt our military into the most powerful it has ever been cut record taxes  regulations fixed the va  gotten choice for our vets (after 45 years)  so much more?.......the conversation with the new and very good ukraine president who told the fake news at the united nations that he was not pressured by me in any way shape or form should by and of itself bring an end to the new and most recent witch hunt. others ended in ashes!the whistleblower’s complaint is completely different and at odds from my actual conversation with the new president of ukraine. the so-called “whistleblower” knew practically nothing in that those ridiculous charges were far more dramatic  wrong just like liddle’ adam schiff......fraudulently and illegally inserted his made up  twisted words into my call with the ukrainian president to make it look like i did something very wrong. he then boldly read those words to congress and millions of people defaming  libeling me. he must resign from congress!it is disgraceful what the do nothing democrats are doing (the impeachment scam) but it is also disgraceful what they are not doing namely the usmca vote prescription drug price reduction gun safety infrastructure and much more!the only people that don’t like my conversation with the new ukrainian president are those that heard rep. adam schiff read a made up and totally fraudulent statement to the house and public words that i did not say but that he fabricated ( admitted to this fabrication). sick!“these are trumped-up charges.” @petehegseth  @foxandfriendslike every american i deserve to meet my accuser especially when this accuser the so-called “whistleblower” represented a perfect conversation with a foreign leader in a totally inaccurate and fraudulent way. then schiff made up what i actually said by lying to congress......his lies were made in perhaps the most blatant and sinister manner ever seen in the great chamber. he wrote down and read terrible things then said it was from the mouth of the president of the united states. i want schiff questioned at the highest level for fraud  treason.........in addition i want to meet not only my accuser who presented second  third hand information but also the person who illegally gave this information which was largely incorrect to the “whistleblower.” was this person spying on the u.s. president? big consequences!these radical left do nothing democrats are doing great harm to our country. they are lying  cheating like never before in our country’s history in order to destabilize the united states of america  it’s upcoming 2020 election. they  the fake news media are dangerous  bad!“all that’s swirling around us now is impeachment. we talk about it day and night it’s what’s on the news there is nothing that has turned up that is impeachable. our founding fathers set impeachment to be extremely rare. we need to get good stuff done. let the people vote........we are going to have an election very shortly.” rep. jeff van drew democrat of new jersey. @foxandfriends  thank you. just another witch hunt by nancy pelosi and the do nothing democrats!“state department has stepped up hillary clinton email probe.” @foxandfriends  you mean the 33000 emails that she has deleted and acid washed so they can never be found even though she said that all 33000 pertained only to her daughter’s wedding and her yoga!“nancy pelosi and the democrats can’t put down the impeachment match. they know they couldn’t beat him in 2016 against hillary clinton and they’re increasingly aware of the fact that they won’t win against him in 2020 and impeachment is the only tool they have to get........rid of donald j. trump - and the democrats don’t care if they burn down and destroy this nation in the process. i have never seen the evangelical christians more angry over any issue than this attempt to illegitimately remove this president from office overturn the 2016........election and negate the votes of millions of evangelicals in the process. they know the only impeachable offense that president trump has committed was beating hillary clinton in 2016. that’s the unpardonable sin for which the democrats will never forgive him.........if the democrats are successful in removing the president from office (which they will never be) it will cause a civil war like fracture in this nation from which our country will never heal.” pastor robert jeffress @foxnewsthe greatest witch hunt in the history of our country!“china trade turmoil: china urging a calm and rational solution.” @mariabartiromo @foxbusiness china is doing very poorly while the usa under your favorite president’s leadership continues to soar to new heights - and despite the do nothing democrats we have just begun!the fake whistleblower complaint is not holding up. it is mostly about the call to the ukrainian president which in the name of transparency i immediately released to congress   the public. the whistleblower knew almost nothing its 2nd hand description of the call is a fraud!rep. adam schiff illegally made up a fake  terrible statement pretended it to be mine as the most important part of my call to the ukrainian president and read it aloud to congress and the american people. it bore no relationship to what i said on the call. arrest for treason?“after many years the united states is finally waking up to beijing’s plans and ambitions to pass us as the dominant economic  military superpower in the 21st century. what’s

whistleblower report? drain the swamp!#fakewhistleblower“president trump’s job approval numbers have just reached the highest level since his inauguration around 50% and you can add to that many votes from voters that don’t talk about their vote. once they saw the president’s numbers going up they said ‘we gotta do something’ so......they made this whole thing up. impeachment is also a pre-emptive strike for what they think is coming on the obama administration’s handling of the 2016 election.” jim mclaughlin highly respected pollster. @washtimes @foxnewsvery simple! i was looking for corruption and also why germany france and others in the european union don’t do more for ukraine. why is it always the usa that does so much and puts up so much money for ukraine and other countries? by the way the bidens were corrupt!the fake news media wants to stay as far away as possible from the ukraine and china deals made by the bidens. a corrupt media is so bad for our country! in actuality the media may be even more corrupt than the bidens which is hard to do!big news by @hyundai @kia and @aptiv on a 4 billion dollar joint venture to develop autonomous driving technologies in

inauguration!congratulations to president xi and the chinese people on the 70th anniversary of the people’s republic of china!“the congratulatory phone call with the ukrainian president was perfect unless you heard liddle’ adam schiff’s fraudulently made up version of the call. this is just another fake news media together with their partner the democrat party hoax!so if the so-called “whistleblower” has all second hand information and almost everything he has said about my “perfect” call with the ukrainian president is wrong (much to the embarrassment of pelosi  schiff) why aren’t we entitled to interview  learn everything about........the whistleblower and also the person who gave all of the false information to him. this is simply about a phone conversation that could not have been nicer warmer or better. no pressure at all (as confirmed by  ukrainian pres.). it is just another democrat hoax!as i predicted jay powell and the federal reserve have allowed the dollar to get so strong especially relative to all other currencies that our manufacturers are being negatively affected. fed rate too high. they are their own worst enemies they don’t have a clue. pathetic!why isn’t congressman adam schiff being brought up on charges for fraudulently making up a statement and reading it to congress as if this statement which was very dishonest and bad for me was directly made by the president of the united states? this should never be allowed!republicans of louisiana it is really important for you to go out and vote on october 12th for either eddie rispone or ralph

governor of that state to tremendous media hoopla. the victory however was barely covered by the fake news. no surprise!massive sections of the wall are being built at our southern border. it is going up rapidly and built to the highest standards and specifications of the border patrol experts. it is actually an amazing structure! our u.s. military is doing a great job.congressman adam schiff should resign for the crime of after reading a transcript of my conversation with the president of ukraine (it was perfect) fraudulently fabricating a statement of the president of the united states and reading it to congress as though mine! he is sick!all the do nothing democrats are focused on is impeaching the president for having a very good conversation with the ukrainian president. i knew

with only the 2020 election in mind!nancy pelosi just said that she is interested in lowering prescription drug prices  working on the desperately needed usmca. she is incapable of working on either. it is just camouflage for trying to win an election through impeachment. the do nothing democrats are stuck in mud!adam schiff should only be so lucky to have the brains honor and strength of

party. always tough to beat the “press” but people are beginning to see how totally corrupt they are and it makes our job a whole lot easier!nancy pelosi today on @gma actually said that adam schiffty schiff didn’t fabricate my words in a major speech before congress. she either had no idea what she was saying in other words lost it or she lied. even clinton lover @gstephanopoulos strongly called her out. sue her?the washington times “ukraine envoy blows ‘massive hole’ into democrat accusations. republicans at hearing find no trump pressure.” the ukrainian president also strongly stated that no pressure was put on him. case closed!as president i have an obligation to end corruption even if that means requesting the help of a foreign country or countries. it is done all the time. this has nothing to do with politics or a political campaign against the bidens. this does have to do with their corruption!breaking news: unemployment rate at 3.5% drops to a 50 year low. wow america lets impeach your president (even though he did nothing wrong!).the whistleblower who had the facts wrong about the phone call reached out and more to the democrat controlled house intelligence committee.

the military son hunter who was handed $100000 a month (plusplus) from a ukrainian based company even though he had no experience in energy.......and separately got 1.5 billion dollars from china despite no experience and for no apparent reason. there is no way these can be legitimate transactions? as lawyers  others have stated as president i have an obligation to look into possible or probable corruption!the biden family was paid off pure and simple! the fake news must stop making excuses for something that is totally inexcusable. sleepy joe said he never spoke to the ukrainian company and then the picture came out where he was playing golf with the company boss and hunter.........and by the way i would love running against 1% joe biden - i just don’t think it’s going to

crimes and misdemeanors and even treason. i guess that means that they along with all of those that evilly “colluded” with them must all be immediately impeached!the united states was supposed to be in syria for 30 days that was many years ago. we stayed and got deeper and deeper into battle with no aim in sight. when i arrived in washington isis was running rampant in the area. we quickly defeated 100% of the isis caliphate.........including capturing thousands of isis fighters mostly from europe. but europe did not want them back they said you keep them usa! i said “no we did you a great favor and now you want us to hold them in u.s. prisons at tremendous cost. they are yours for trials.” they..........again said “no” thinking as usual that the u.s. is always the “sucker” on nato on trade on everything. the kurds fought with us but were paid massive amounts of money and equipment to do so. they have been fighting turkey for decades. i held off this fight for........almost 3 years but it is time for us to get out of these ridiculous endless wars many of them tribal and bring our soldiers home. we will fight where it is to our benefit and only fight to win. turkey europe syria iran iraq russia and the kurds will now have to........figure the situation out and what they want to do with the captured isis fighters in their “neighborhood.” they all hate isis have been enemies for years. we are 7000 miles away and will crush isis again if they come anywhere near us!we just won the big court case on net neutrality rules! a great win for the future and speed of the internet. will lead to many big things including 5g. congratulations to the fcc and its chairman ajit pai!“ig: declassified information contradicts the whistleblower.” @foxandfriends  but why are people surprised? the “partisan” whistleblower was very wrong on what was said on my perfect “no pressure” call with the ukrainian president. bring in another whistleblower from the bench!“incomes much higher under trump than bush obama.” @foxandfriends and almost everything else is better also (except i am driving the deep state and the radical left do nothing democrats crazy)!heritage foundation “these numbers are blockbusters. just since donald trump took office median family incomrs are up over $4100. in 8 years under president obama they only went up $1000. in one third the time president trump has increased incomes 4 times as much and that.......doesn’t even include the almost $2000 that the families got from the trump tax cut.” stephen moore freedomworks  that means $5000 to $6000 more in disposable yearly income that americans have right now because of president trump!the radical left democrats have failed on all fronts so now they are pushing local new york city and state democrat prosecutors to go get president trump. a thing like this has never happened to any president before. not even close!i was elected on getting out of these ridiculous endless wars where our great military functions as a policing operation to the benefit of people who don’t even like the usa. the two most unhappy countries at this move are russia  china because they love seeing us bogged.........down watching over a quagmire  spending big dollars to do so. when i took over our military was totally depleted. now it is stronger than ever before. the endless and ridiculous wars are ending! we will be focused on the big picture knowing we can always go back  blast!as i have stated strongly before and just to reiterate if turkey does anything that i in my great and unmatched wisdom consider to be off limits i will totally destroy and obliterate the economy of turkey (i’ve done before!). they must with europe and others watch over...“there are no felonies there are no impeachable offenses. the constitution’s very clear that you need bribery treason or other high crimes and misdemeanors. you can’t be impeached for the conduct that’s been alleged in this case.” @alandersh dershowitz. @seanhannity  a scam!so many people conveniently forget that turkey is a big trading partner of the united states in fact they make the structural steel frame for our f-35 fighter jet. they have also been good to deal with helping me to save many lives at idlib province and returning in very..........good health at my request pastor brunson who had many years of a long prison term remaining. also remember and importantly that turkey is an important member in good standing of nato. he is coming to the u.s. as my guest on november 13th. #endendlesswarswe may be in the process of leaving syria but in no way have we abandoned the kurds who are special people and wonderful fighters. likewise our relationship with turkey a nato and trading partner has been very good. turkey already has a large kurdish population and fully........understands that while we only had 50 soldiers remaining in that section of syria and they have been removed any unforced or unnecessary fighting by turkey will be devastating to their economy and to their very fragile currency. we are helping the kurds financially/weapons!i would love to send ambassador sondland a really good man and great american to testify but unfortunately he would be testifying before a totally compromised kangaroo court where republican’s rights have been taken away and true facts are not allowed out for the public........to see. importantly ambassador sondland’s tweet which few report stated “i believe you are incorrect about president trump’s intentions. the president has been crystal clear: no quid pro quo’s of any kind.” that says it all!i think that crooked hillary clinton should enter the race to try and steal it away from uber left elizabeth warren. only one condition. the crooked one must explain all of her high crimes and misdemeanors including how  why she deleted 33000 emails after getting “c” subpoena!thank you to lt. bob kroll of the great minneapolis police department for your kind words on @foxandfriends. the police are fighting the radical left mayor and his ridiculous uniform ban. actually i love the cops for trump shirts. want to bring some home. i am with you 100%!!!!someone please tell the radical left mayor of minneapolis that he can’t price out free speech. probably illegal! i stand strongly  proudly with the great police officers and law enforcement of minneapolis and the great state of minnesota! see you thursday night!hasn’t adam schiff been fully discredited by now? do we have to continue listening to his lies?radical left dem mayor of minneapolis jacob frey is doing everything possible to stifle free speech despite a record sell-out crowd at the target center. presidents clinton and obama paid almost nothing! the minneapolis police have been incredible........in fact the “cops for trump” t-shirt web site crashed because of incredible volume but is now back up and running. proceeds go to the police union charities. see you on thursday night in minneapolis!big rally in louisiana on friday night. must force a runoff with a liberal democrat governor john bel edwards who has let your taxes and car insurance get too high and will never protect your 2nd amendment. vote for one of our two great republicans on saturday force a runoff!....if there is a runoff in louisiana you will have a great new republican governor who will cut your taxes and car insurance and do a fabulous job for you and your family. vote republican the party of honest abe lincoln!gasoline prices in the state of california are much higher than anywhere else in the nation ($2.50 vs. $4.50). i guess those very expensive and unsafe cars that they are mandating just aren’t doing the trick! don’t worry california relief is on the way. the state doesn’t get it!“bob mueller was pursuing the fbi director job when he met with president trump in 2017 administration officials say.” @foxnews  bret baier and jake gibson @seanhannity this is true even though mueller denied it!wow just breaking: “the (big deal) whistleblower had a ‘professional tie’ to 2020 democratic candidate.” washington examiner @byronyork  in other words was working with someone who was potentially running against me. why wasn’t this reported by the icig? a witch hunt scam!the whistleblower’s facts have been so incorrect about my “no pressure” conversation with the ukrainian president and now the conflict of interest and involvement with a democrat candidate that he or she should be exposed and questioned properly. this is no whistleblower..........the whistleblower’s lawyer is a big democrat. the whistleblower has ties to one of my democrat opponents. why does the icig allow this scam to continue?the united states has spent eight trillion dollars fighting and policing in the middle east. thousands of our great soldiers have died or been badly wounded. millions of people have died on the other side. going into the middle east is the worst decision ever made.........in the history of our country! we went to war under a false  now disproven premise weapons of mass destruction. there were none! now we are slowly  carefully bringing our great soldiers  military home. our focus is on the big picture! the usa is greater than ever before!the do nothing democrats are con artists only looking to hurt the republican party and president. their total focus is 2020 nothing more and nothing less. the good news is that we will win!!!!the so-called whistleblower before knowing i was going to release the exact transcript stated that my call with the ukrainian president was “crazy frightening and completely lacking in substance related to national security.” this is a very big lie. read the transcript!....no pressure at all said ukraine! very congenial a perfect call. the whistleblower and others spoke before seeing the transcript. now they must apologize to me and stop this ridiculous impeachment!so why is someone a good or great president if they needed to spy on someone else’s campaign in order to win (that didn’t work out so well) and if they were unable to fill 142 important federal judgeships (a record by far) handing them all to me to chose. will have 182 soon!president obama said that he did not have the right to sign daca that it will never hold up in court. he signed it anyway! if the supreme court upholds daca it gives the president extraordinary powers far greater than ever thought. if they do what is right and do not let..........daca stand with all of its negative legal implications the republicans and democrats will have a deal to let them stay in our country in very short order. it would actually benefit daca and be done the right way!so why is someone a good or great president if they needed to spy on someone else’s campaign in order to win (that didn’t work out so well) and if they were unable to fill 142 important federal judgeships (a record by far) handing them all to me to choose. will have 182 soon!only 25 percent want the president impeached which is pretty low considering the volume of fake news coverage but pretty high considering the fact that i did nothing wrong. it is all just a continuation of the greatest scam and witch hunt in the history of our country!so pathetic to see sleepy joe biden who with his son hunter and to the detriment of the american taxpayer has ripped off at least two countries for millions of dollars calling for my impeachment - and i did nothing wrong. joe’s failing campaign gave him no other choice!“i don’t think it’s a whistleblower at all. i think this is an anonymous source for the democratic staff in the house of representatives. this is an insult to real whistleblowers. actual whistleblowers go on to have their whole lives upended.” john kiriakou  @tuckercarlsonin case the kurds or turkey lose control the united states has already taken the 2 isis militants tied to beheadings in syria known as the beetles out of that country and into a secure location controlled by the u.s. they are the worst of the worst!from the day i announced i was running for president i have never had a good @foxnews poll. whoever their pollster is they suck. but @foxnews is also much different than it used to be in the good old days. with people like andrew napolitano who wanted to be a supreme.......court justice  i turned him down (he’s been terrible ever since) shep smith @donnabrazile (who gave crooked hillary the debate questions  got fired from @cnn)  others @foxnews doesn’t deliver for us anymore. it is so different than it used to be. oh well i’m president!turkey has been planning to attack the kurds for a long time. they have been fighting forever. we have no soldiers or military anywhere near the attack area. i am trying to end the endless wars. talking to both sides. some want us to send tens of thousands of soldiers to........the area and start a new war all over again. turkey is a member of nato. others say stay out let the kurds fight their own battles (even with our financial help). i say hit turkey very hard financially  with sanctions if they don’t play by the rules! i am watching closely.thank you to @oann one america news for your fair coverage and brilliant reporting. it is appreciated by many people trying so hard to find a new consistent and powerful voice! see you tonight at the big rally in minneapolis.the president of the ukraine just stated again in the strongest of language that president trump applied no pressure and did absolutely nothing wrong. he used the strongest language possible. that should end this democrat scam but it won’t because the dems  media are fixed!why isn’t the ig investigating his so-called whistleblower? all bad info!big day of negotiations with china. they want to make a deal but do i? i meet with the vice premier tomorrow at the white house.we defeated 100% of the isis caliphate and no longer have any troops in the area under attack by turkey in syria. we did our job perfectly! now turkey is attacking the kurds who have been fighting each other for 200 years........we have one of three choices: send in thousands of troops and win militarily hit turkey very hard financially and with sanctions or mediate a deal between turkey and the kurds!good things are happening at china trade talk meeting. warmer feelings than in recent past more like the old days. i will be meeting with the vice premier today. all would like to see something significant happen!i will be in louisiana tonight (love it!) to get republicans to vote for either of our two great republican candidates and force a run off with john bel edwards who has done a really poor job of tax cutting car insurance cost (worst in usa)  is suspect on your 2nd amendment!one of the great things about the china deal is the fact that for various reasons we do not have to go through the very long and politically complex congressional approval process. when the deal is fully negotiated i sign it myself on behalf of our country. fast and clean!will be with our two great senators @senjohnkennedy  @senbillcassidy tonight in louisiana. these two hard working really smart men love their country and love their state. we will hopefully add a great new republican governor to the beautiful louisiana mix! see you tonight!kevin mcaleenan has done an outstanding job as acting secretary of homeland security. we have worked well together with border crossings being way down. kevin now after many years in government wants to spend more time with his family and go to the private sector........congratulations kevin on a job well done! i will be announcing the new acting secretary next week. many wonderful candidates!where’s hunter?so funny to watch steve kerr grovel and pander when asked a simple question about china. he chocked and looks weak and pathetic. don’t want him at the white house!“i never saw so many subpoenas!” @shannonbream  @foxnews  the democrats have gone crazy. just read the transcript or listen to the new ukraine president’s statement no pressure! this is a democrat con job. impeach schiff for fraud!“schiff aides worked with whistleblower.” @foxandfriends  @repleezeldin  schiff is a lying mess!the case of major mathew golsteyn is now under review at the white house. mathew is a highly decorated green beret who is being tried for killing a taliban bombmaker. we train our boys to be killing machines then prosecute them when they kill! @petehegseththe deal i just made with china is by far the greatest and biggest deal ever made for our great patriot farmers in the history of our country. in fact there is a question as to whether or not this much product can be produced? our farmers will figure it out. thank you china!....other aspects of the deal are also great - technology financial services 16-20 billion in boeing planes etc. but wow the farmers really hit pay dirt! @chuckgrassley @joniernst @debfisher @bensasse  thank you to all republicans in congress for your invaluable help!louisiana get out and vote republican before going to the big game today. a runoff will be a tremendous win for your great state - lower taxes and car insurance and better protection of your 2nd amendment! fantastic being with you last night!so now they are after the legendary “crime buster” and greatest mayor in the history of nyc rudy giuliani. he may seem a little rough around the edges sometimes but he is also a great guy and wonderful lawyer. such a one sided witch hunt going on in usa. deep state. shameful!the endless wars must end!the governor of louisiana john bel edwards has done a poor job. now he is in a runoff with a great republican @eddierispone. thank you louisiana! 66% down to 47% after i explained what a bad job the governor was doing.the same people that got us into the middle east quicksand 8 trillion dollars and many thousands of lives (and millions of lives when you count the other side) are now fighting to keep us there. don’t listen to people that haven’t got a clue. they have proven to be inept!congratulations to the great state of louisiana. a big night. you will soon have a new and wonderful governor @eddierispone. your taxes and car insurance payments will go down!the media is not talking about the big republican victory last night in louisiana where a sitting democrat governor was forced into a runoff by not getting 50%. big upset! now @eddierispone who will be a great governor will win!very smart not to be involved in the intense fighting along the turkish border for a change. those that mistakenly got us into the middle east wars are still pushing to fight. they have no idea what a bad decision they have made. why are they not asking for a declaration of war?do you remember two years ago when iraq was going to fight the kurds in a different part of syria. many people wanted us to fight with the kurds against iraq who we just fought for. i said no and the kurds left the fight twice. now the same thing is happening with turkey...........the kurds and turkey have been fighting for many years. turkey considers the pkk the worst terrorists of all. others may want to come in and fight for one side or the other. let them! we are monitoring the situation closely. endless wars!dealing with @lindseygrahamsc and many members of congress including democrats about imposing powerful sanctions on turkey. treasury is ready to go additional legislation may be sought. there is great consensus on this. turkey has asked that it not be done. stay tuned!where’s hunter? he has totally disappeared! now looks like he has raided and scammed even more countries! media is awol.we have become a far greater economic power than ever before and we are using that power for world peace!the democrats are going to lose a lot of house seats because of their fraudulent use of impeachment. schiff fabricated phone call a crime. democrat senate seats will also be put at risk even some that were supposedly safe. look at louisiana last night north carolina last week!....i agreed not to increase tariffs from 25% to 30% on october 15th. they will remain at 25%. the relationship with china is very good. we will finish out the large phase one part of the deal then head directly into phase two. the phase one deal can be finalized  signed soon!“congressman adam schiff who when seeing the real ukraine phone call transcript decided he’d better make up one of his own. ‘i’m going to say this only seven times so you better listen good. i want you to make up dirt on my political opponent understand lots of it and..........by the way don’t call me again i’ll call you when you’ve done what i’ve asked.’” a reminder that wasn’t just stupid it was false.” @greggutfeld @greggutfeldshow @foxnews  i never said this. schiff made it up and read it to congress  the american people. end witch hunt!.@marklevinshow on @foxnews is doing a big show tonight on the democrat’s impeachment scam. 10:00 p.m. no guests just mark. he is angry (like so many others!). at 9:00 p.m. on @foxnews steve hilton is looking into the crooked bidens. where’s hunter?the u.s. has the worst of the isis prisoners. turkey and the kurds must not let them escape. europe should have taken them back after numerous requests. they should do it now. they will never come to or be allowed in the united states!somebody please explain to chris wallace of fox who will never be his father (and my friend) mike wallace that the phone conversation i had with the president of ukraine was a congenial  good one. it was only schiff’s made up version of that conversation that was bad!“serial killers get more due process than the democrats give to the president of the united states.” @marklevinshow“the democrats are trashing this president  in the process trashing the u.s. constitution. frankly the american people need to wake up to the reality that the democrats are so drunk on power that they’re willing to destroy this constitutional republic.” @grahamledger @oannadam schiff now doesn’t seem to want the whistleblower to testify. no! must testify to explain why he got my ukraine conversation sooo wrong not even close. did schiff tell him to do that? we must determine the whistleblower’s identity to determine why this was done to the usa......democrat’s game was foiled when we caught schiff fraudulently making up my ukraine conversation when i released the exact conversation transcript and when ukrainian president and the foreign minister said there was no pressure very normal talk! a total impeachment scam!brian kilmeade over at @foxandfriends got it all wrong. we are not going into another war between people who have been fighting with each other for 200 years. europe had a chance to get their isis prisoners but didn’t want the cost. “let the usa pay” they said.......kurds may be releasing some to get us involved. easily recaptured by turkey or european nations from where many came but they should move quickly. big sanctions on turkey coming! do people really think we should go to war with nato member turkey? never ending wars will end!the same people who got us into the middle east mess are the people who most want to stay there!happy columbus day!vote for good guy @seanspicer tonight on dancing with the stars. he has always been there for us!will be looking into the scott hapgood case and the island of anguilla. something looks and sounds very wrong. i know anguilla will want to see this case be properly and justly resolved! @foxandfriends @steveducey  @ainsleyearhardtwow! hunter biden is being forced to leave a chinese company. now watch the fake news wrap their greasy and very protective arms around him. only softball questions of him please!america first!the fox impeachment poll has turned out to be incorrect. this was announced on friday. despite this the corrupt new york times used this poll in one of its stories no mention........of the correction which they knew about full well! “fox news pollster braun research misrepresented impeachment poll: analysis” @nypostgreat new book \"resistance (at all costs): how trump haters are breaking america\" out by kimberley strassel of the wall street journal. kim has treated us fairly and for that i am very appreciative. check it out today it is great!“to his credit the europeans didn\\'t step up to deal with this isis problem – it’s a lot of the reason why we are in this situation today. now angela merkel of germany is finally stepping up and telling turkey to back off........don\\'t the europeans have a lot of responsibility?” @katiepavlich thank you katie i offered isis prisoners to the european countries from where they came and was rejected on numerous occasions. they probably figured that the u.s. would bear the tremendous cost as always!after defeating 100% of the isis caliphate i largely moved our troops out of syria. let syria and assad protect the kurds and fight turkey for their own land. i said to my generals why should we be fighting for syria........and assad to protect the land of our enemy? anyone who wants to assist syria in protecting the kurds is good with me whether it is russia china or napoleon bonaparte. i hope they all do great we are 7000 miles away!some people want the united states to protect the 7000 mile away border of syria presided over by bashar al-assad our enemy. at the same time syria and whoever they chose to help wants naturally to protect the kurds........i would much rather focus on our southern border which abuts and is part of the united states of america. and by the way numbers are way down and the wall is being built!shifty schiff now seems to think they don’t need the whistleblower who started the whole scam. the reason is that the whistleblower has lost all credibility because the story is so far from the facts on the transcrpt. also the second whistleblower is no longer even mentioned!shifty schiff now seems to think they don’t need the whistleblower who started the whole scam. the reason is that the whistleblower has lost all credibility because the story is so far from the facts on the transcript. also the second whistleblower is no longer even mentioned!a big scandal at @abc news. they got caught using really gruesome fake footage of the turks bombing in syria. a real disgrace. tomorrow they will ask softball questions to sleepy joe biden’s son hunter like why did ukraine  china pay you millions when you knew nothing? payoff?“project veritas-obtained undercover videos highlight jeff zucker’s (@cnn) campaign to destroy trump. videos reveal @cnn’s bias!” @tuckercarlson @foxnews does this sound like a good or even great lawsuit?democrats are allowing no transparency at the witch hunt hearings. if republicans ever did this they would be excoriated by the fake news. let the facts come out from the charade of people most of whom i do not know they are interviewing for 9 hours each not selective leaks.hunter biden was really bad on @gma. now sleepy joe has real problems! reminds me of crooked hillary and her 33000 deleted emails not recoverable!governor @mattbevin has done a wonderful job for the people of kentucky! he continues to protect your very important second amendment. matt is strong on crime and the border he loves our great vets and military. matt has my complete and total endorsement and always has!just out: median household income is at the highest point ever ever ever! how about saying it this way in the history

election for governor on november 5th. i need you to get out and vote for our great republican nominee @tatereeves. tate is strong on crime tough on illegal immigration and will protect your second amendment........he loves our military and supports our vets! get out and vote for tate reeves on november 5th. he has my complete and total endorsement!shifty adam schiff wants to rest his entire case on a whistleblower who he now says can’t testify  the reason he can’t testify is that he is afraid to do so because his account of the presidential telephone call is a fraud  totally different from the actual transcribed call...you would think there is no way that any of the democrat candidates that we witnessed last night could possibly become president of the united states. now you see why they have no choice but to push a totally illegal  absurd impeachment of one of the most successful presidents!“what is happening to president trump with impeachment is a constitutional travesty.” @grahamledger  the likes of which we have never seen before. it is adam schiff and nancy pelosi who should be impeached for fraud!95% approval rating in the republican party. thank you! just won two congressional seats in north carolina   a governors runoff in louisiana which republicans should now win! because of impeachment fraud we will easily take back the house add in the senate  again win pres!our record economy would crash just like in 1929 if any of those clowns became president!republicans are totally deprived of their rights in this impeachment witch hunt. no lawyers no questions no transparency! the good news is that the radical left dems have no case. it is all based on their fraud and fabrication!senator rand paul just wrote a great book “the case against socialism” which is now out. highly recommended – as america was founded on liberty  independence – not government coercion domination  control. we were born free and will stay free as long as i am your president!guatemala honduras  el salvador have all signed historic asylum cooperation agreements and are working to end the scourge of human smuggling. to further accelerate this progress the u.s. will shortly be approving targeted assistance in the areas of law enforcement  security.nancy pelosi needs help fast! there is either something wrong with her “upstairs” or she just plain doesn’t like our great country. she had a total meltdown in the white house today. it was very sad to watch. pray for her she is a very sick person!“this president is the most patriotic president i’ve seen in many years. he is going to do what is good for americans.”  congressman brian babin texas. thank you brian!“what has happened here with the anthony wiener laptop the server all of the emails between huma

person who can fight for the safety of our troops  bring them home from the ridiculous  costly endless wars and be scorned. democrats always liked that position until i took it. democrats always liked walls until i built them. do you see what’s happening here?my warmest condolences to the family and many friends of congressman elijah cummings. i got to see first hand the strength passion and wisdom of this highly respected political leader. his work and voice on so many fronts will be very hard if not impossible to replace!great news out of turkey. news conference shortly with @vp and @secpompeo. thank you to @rterdogan. millions of lives will be saved!this deal could never have been made 3 days ago. there needed to be some “tough” love in order to get it done. great for everybody. proud of all!just spoke to president @rterdogan of turkey. he told me there was minor sniper and mortar fire that was quickly eliminated. he very much wants the ceasefire or pause to work. likewise the kurds want it and the ultimate solution to happen. too bad there wasn’t..........this thinking years ago. instead it was always held together with very weak bandaids  in an artificial manner. there is good will on both sides  a really good chance for success. the u.s. has secured the oil  the isis fighters are double secured by kurds  turkey........i have just been notified that some european nations are now willing for the first time to take the isis fighters that came from their nations. this is good news but should have been done after we captured them. anyway big progress being made!!!!can you believe i am doing this important work for our country and have to deal with corrupt adam schiff and the do nothing democrats at the same time? it was not intended to be this way for a president!i want to thank secretary of energy rick perry for the outstanding job he has done. he will be leaving at the end of the year to pursue other interests. rick was a great governor of texas and a great secretary of energy........he is also my friend! at the same time i am pleased to nominate deputy secretary dan brouillette to be the new secretary of energy. dan’s experience in the sector is unparalleled. a total professional i have no doubt that dan will do a great job!think of how many lives we saved in syria and turkey by getting a ceasefire yesterday. thousands and thousands and maybe many more!corrupt congressman adam schiff is angry that ambassadors that he thought would be good for his fraudulent witch hunt are turning out to be good for me - some really good! he’s got

to do it at no profit or if legally permissible at zero cost to the usa. but as usual the hostile media  their democrat partners went crazy!so now crooked hillary is at it again! she is calling congresswoman tulsi gabbard “a russian favorite” and jill stein “a russian asset.” as you may have heard i was called a big russia lover also (actually i do like russian people. i like all people!). hillary’s gone crazy!mark esperanto secretary of defense “the ceasefire is holding up very nicely. there are some minor skirmishes that have ended quickly. new areas being resettled with the kurds.” usa soldiers are not in combat or ceasefire zones. we have secured the oil. bringing soldiers home!“the ceasefire is holding up very nicely. there are some minor skirmishes that have ended quickly. new areas being resettled with kurds. u.s. soldiers are not in combat or ceasefire zone. we have secured the oil.” mark esper secretary of defense. ending endless wars!pelosi is now leading a delegation of 9 including corrupt adam schiff to jordan to check out syria. she should find out why obama drew the red line in the sand  then did nothing losing syria  all respect. i did something 58 missiles. one million died under obama’s mistake!this scam going on right now by the democrats against the republican party and me was all about a perfect phone call i had with the ukrainian president. he’s already stated no pressure! where is the whistleblower or the 2nd whistleblower or the “informant?” all gone.........because their so-called story didn’t come even close to matching up with the exact transcript of the phone call. was it a corrupt adam schiff con? why didn’t the ig see this? when do we depose shifty schiff to find out why he fraudulently made up my phone call and read this......fiction to congress and the american people?  i demand his deposition. he is a fraud just like the russia hoax was and the ukraine hoax is now. when do the do nothing democrats pay a price for what they are doing to our country  when do the republicans finally fight back?so interesting that when i announced trump national doral in miami would be used for the hosting of the g-7 and then rescinded due to do nothing democrat/fake news anger very few in media mentioned that no profits would be taken or would be given free if legally permissible!great new book by wonderful and very street smart author dan bongino exonerated the failed takedown of president donald trump by the swamp. dan hits all of the crooked points of the greatest witch hunt in political history. nevertheless the scam continues!censure (at least) corrupt adam schiff! after what he got caught doing any pol who does not so vote cannot be honest....are you listening dems?doral in miami would have been the best place to hold the g-7 and free but too much heat from the do nothing radical left democrats  their partner the fake news media! i’m surprised that they allow me to give up my $400000 plus presidential salary! we’ll find someplace else!congratulations to @justintrudeau on a wonderful and hard fought victory. canada is well served. i look forward to working with you toward the betterment of both of our countries!“the ambassador to the european union has already testified he said there was no quid pro quo. he said the president had told him that.” @kilmeade  @foxandfriends“i thought a very revealing poll was done by the new york times. by about a 10 point margin those in battleground states polled are against impeaching the president and if nancy pelosi doesn’t take note of that maybe she is the third rate politician.” @kilmeade @foxandfriends...a majority do not want him impeached and removed from office. 94% of the people in these battleground states who voted for president trump want him to continue as president. that’s squarely in his corner.” @stevedoocy “that’s a revealing poll don’t you think that matters?”.......@kilmeade   “i want to know about hillary clinton with the dossier? i want to know if there was fisa abuse? we’re still waiting for that report!” @ainsleyearhardt  @foxandfriendsso some day if a democrat becomes president and the republicans win the house even by a tiny margin they can impeach the president without due process or fairness or any legal rights. all republicans must remember what they are witnessing here - a lynching. but we will win!thank you republicans. 185 out of 185 present voted for “us” last night. really good!95% approval rating in the republican party. thank you!can’t believe that nervous nancy pelosi isn’t moving faster on usmca. her people want it they don’t know why she isn’t putting it up for a bipartisan vote. taking too long!“the democrats are trying to draw out this inquiry because they don’t have the support. donald trump is guilty only of winning the 2016 election.” @mzhemingway @foxandfriendsgood news seems to be happening with respect to turkey syria and the middle east. further reports to come later!neither he (taylor) or any other witness has provided testimony that the ukrainians were aware that military aid was being withheld. you can’t have a quid pro quo with no quo.” congressman john ratcliffe @foxandfriends where is the whistleblower? the do nothing dems case is dead!republicans are going to fight harder than ever to win back the house because of what the do nothing democrats have done to our country!young campus conservatives are flocking to turning point usa  other conservative speaker events all over the country and in record numbers. thousands of students are turning out. “i just want to compliment the president of the united states for signing that historic executive......order a couple of months ago saying that any school that does not uphold the first amendment rights of its students will lose federal funding. we have seen a huge change in how the universities interact with us as a national  local student organization. our studends........feel empowered. there’s a movement happening on these campuses like i’ve never seen before. when you have 3000 students wanting to get into an event that couldn’t get in that’s pretty remarkable!”  @charliekirk11 turning point usa   keep america great!big success on the turkey/syria border. safe zone created! ceasefire has held and combat missions have ended. kurds are safe and have worked very nicely with us. captured isis prisoners secured. i will be making a statement at 11:00 a.m. from the white house. thank you!where’s the whistleblower?thank you general mazloum for your kind words and courage. please extend my warmest regards to the kurdish people. i look forward to seeing you soon. @mustefabalithe never trumper republicans though on respirators with not many left are in certain ways worse and more dangerous for our country than the do nothing democrats. watch out for them they are human scum!never trumper republican john bellinger represents never trumper diplomat bill taylor (who i don’t know) in testimony before congress! do nothing democrats allow republicans zero representation zero due process and zero transparency........does anybody think this is fair? even though there was no quid pro quo i’m sure they would like to try. worse than the dems!it would be really great if the people within the trump administration all well-meaning and good (i hope!) could stop hiring never trumpers who are worse than the do nothing democrats. nothing good will ever come from them!(kiddingly) we’re building a wall in colorado”(then stated “we’re not building a wall in kansas but they get the benefit of the wall we’re building on the border”) refered to people in the very packed auditorium from colorado  kansas getting the benefit of the border wall!the federal reserve is derelict in its duties if it doesn’t lower the rate and even ideally stimulate. take a look around the world at our competitors. germany and others are  actually getting paid to borrow money. fed was way too fast to raise and way too slow to cut!thank you to house republicans for being tough smart and understanding in detail the greatest witch hunt in american history. it has been going on since long before i even got elected (the insurance policy!). a total scam!i really enjoyed my conversation with general @mazloumabdi. he appreciates what we have done and i appreciate what the kurds have done. perhaps it is time for the kurds to start heading to the oil region!where is the whistleblower and why did he or she write such a fictitious and incorrect account of my phone call with the ukrainian president? why did the ig allow this to happen? who is the so-called informant (schiff?) who was so inaccurate? a giant scam!another big dropout of the presidential race was along with 0% tim ryan 0% @repswalwell. such talk and bravado from both and nothing to show. they stood for nothing and the voters couldn’t stand by them. obnoxious and greedy politicians never make it in the end!so congressman tim ryan of ohio has finally dropped out of the race for president registering zero in the polls  unable to even qualify for the debate stage. see tim it’s not so easy out there if you don’t know what you’re doing. he wasn’t effective for usa workers just talk!turkey fully understands not to fire on the kurds as they leave what will be known as the safe zone for other fairly nearby areas. i don’t have to repeat that large scale sanctions will be imposed for violations. going well! isis secured by kurds with turkey ready as backup.........usa has gained trillions of dollars in wealth since november 2016. all others way down. our power is economic before having to use our newly rebuilt military a much better alternative. oil is secured. our soldiers have left and are leaving syria for other places then........coming home! we were supposed to be there for 30 days - that was 10 years ago. when these pundit fools who have called the middle east wrong for 20 years ask what we are getting out of the deal i simply say the oil and we are bringing our soldiers back home isis secured!“donald j. trump is an absolutely historic president already in less than 3 years in office. his record is there for everyone to look at  to examine and compare. this is an illegitimate effort to overthrow a president not a formal impeachment inquiry.” @loudobbs  thank you loui appreciate the support of senator @lindseygraham @senatemajldr mitch mcconnell and their great senate republican colleagues on the resolution condemning the do nothing democrats for their witch hunt impeachment inquiry behind closed doors....to tim: the button on the iphone was far better than the swipe!democrats just announced that they no longer want the whistleblower to testify. but everything was about the whistleblower (they no longer want the second whistleblower either) which they don’t want because the account of my call bore no relationship to the call itself.........the entire impeachment scam was based on my perfect ukrainian call and the whistleblowers account of that call which turned out to be false (a fraud?). once i released the actual call their entire case fell apart. the democrats must end this scam now. witch hunt!my lawyers should sue the democrats and shifty adam schiff for fraud!“general michael flynn’s attorney is demanding that charges be immediately dropped after they found that fbi agents manipulated records against him. they say that james clapper told a reporter to “take a kill shot at flynn. this has been a complete setup of michael flynn........they exonerated him completely of being an agent of russia (recently crooked hillary charged tulsi gabbard  jill stein with the same thing-sick) and yet mr. comey still runs to the white house on february 14 and conjures up the obstruction of justice narrative against.......the president when flynn had been cleared of everything long before that. the doj is withholding a lot of evidence  information as are clapper  brennan  all of the people who participated in the complete setup of michael flynn.”(terrible!) sidney powell. this is a disgrace!...thank you @foxandfriends! hopefully this is just the beginning of a massive story of injustice and treason. you will never learn this from the corrupt lamestream media who get pulitzer prizes for reporting the story totally wrong. the ones who report it right get only respect!had a beautiful dinner last night at camp david in celebration of the 10th wedding anniversary of ivanka and jared. attended by a small number of family and friends it could not have been nicer. camp david is a special place. cost of the event will be totally paid for by me!“not a single american citizen has been charged with anything related to russian collusion not one person.” @tuckercarlson  it was all an illegal witch hunt!i can’t believe that nancy pelosi’s district in san francisco is in such horrible shape that the city itself is in violation of many sanitary  environmental orders causing it to owe the federal government billions of dollars - and all she works on is impeachment.........we should all work together to clean up these hazardous waste and homeless sites before the whole city rots away. very bad and dangerous conditions also severely impacting the pacific ocean and water supply. pelosi must work on this mess and turn her district around!the ukraine investigation is just as corrupt and fake as all of the other garbage that went on before it. even shifty schiff got caught cheating when he made up what i said on the call!badly failing presidential candidate @kamalaharris will not go to a very wonderful largely african american event today because yesterday i recieved a major award at the same event for being able to produce  sign into law major criminal justice reform legislation which will......greatly help the african american community (and all other communities) and which was unable to get done in past administrations despite a tremendous desire for it. this and best unemployment numbers ever is more than kamala will ever be able to do for african americans!....the fake washington post keeps doing phony stories with zero sources that i am concerned with the impeachment scam. i am not because i did nothing wrong. it is the other side including schiff and his made up story that are concerned.

nothing democrats impeach me over that! drain the swamp!!“americans know by now that the impeachment inquiry is just another hoax and silent coup to remove the president from office.” j.j. crovatto  don’t worry j.j. schiff is a leaker  corrupt politician who made up what i said on the call in order to hurt the republican party  me!the only crimes in the impeachment hoax were committed by shifty adam schiff when he totally made up my phone conversation with the ukrainian president and read it to congress together with numerous others on shifty’s side. schiff should be impeached and worse!the do nothing democrats are working hard to make everyone forget the best economy ever the monumental weekend raid tax cuts the rebuilding of our military etc. the impeachment hoax is a disgrace. read the transcript!how many more never trumpers will be allowed to testify about a perfectly appropriate phone call when all anyone has to do is read the transcript! i knew people were listening in on the call (why would i say something inappropriate?) which was fine with me but why so many?supposedly according to the corrupt media the ukraine call “concerned” today’s never trumper witness. was he on the same call that i was? can’t be possible! please ask him to read the transcript of the call. witch hunt!95% approval rating in the republican party a record. thank you!just confirmed that abu bakr

nancy pelosi is doing everything possible to destroy the republican party. our polls show that it is going to be just the opposite. the do nothing dems will lose many seats in 2020. they have a death wish led by a corrupt politician adam schiff!republicans are very unified and energized in our fight on the impeachment hoax with the do nothing democrats and now  are starting to go after the substance even more than the very infair process because just a casual reading of the transcript leads everybody to see that..........the call with the ukrainian president was a totally appropriate one. as he said “no pressure.” this impeachment nonsense is just a continuation of the witch hunt hoax which has been going on since before i even got elected. rupublicans go with substance and close it out!the greatest economy in american history!“it does appear it has to do with nancy pelosi retaining her speakership in the next congress. she would like that so she’s going to put it to a vote because that’s what her political left really wants.” @stevedoocy @foxandfriends  a disgraceful use of impeachment. will backfire!a federal judge is allowing the nick sandman libel suit to move forward against the thoroughly disgusting washington post (which is no longer available at the white house!). he could now have a good chance of winning. go nick!yesterday’s never trumper witness could find no quid pro quo in the transcript of the phone call. there were many people listening to the call. how come they (including the president of ukraine) found nothing wrong with it. witch

@nationals“now is the time for republicans to stand together and defend the leader of their party against these smears. it would be one thing if there were any indication of an underlying crime but there is not-not in the transcripts and not in the secret witness testimony that..........the dems have selectively leaked. nor was there any corrupt intent on the part of the president. remember the president knew that that call was being heard and documented by many people. anyone with intent would be a tad more discreet don’t you think? this farce should.......never be allowed to roll into a winter showtrial. indeed allowing a long drawn out trial in the senate would merely validate and perpetuate the fraud begun in the house. the crisis is of the democrats own making and it’s up to republicans to make sure this never happens.........to any president of either party again. laura @ingrahamanglechina and the usa are working on selecting a new site for signing of phase one of trade

know the dems are saying that they have your vote locked up but that would mean a long slide down. vote republican today!fantastic being in the great state of kentucky last night. vote for matt bevin now! @mattbevin  one of best governors in u.s. he will never let you down!“the impeachment hoax has fired up voters in kentucky mississippi and louisiana.” @foxandfriendsa wonderful family and friends from utah got caught between two vicious drug cartels who were shooting at each other with the result being many great american people killed including young children and some missing. if mexico needs or requests help in cleaning out these.........monsters the united states stands ready willing  able to get involved and do the job quickly and effectively. the great new president of mexico has made this a big issue but the cartels have become so large and powerful that you sometimes need an army to defeat an army!this is the time for mexico with the help of the united states to wage war on the drug cartels and wipe them off the face of the earth. we merely await a call from your great new president!so sad to see what is happening in new york where governor cuomo and mayor deblasio are letting out 900 criminals some hardened and bad onto the sidewalks of our rapidly declining because of them city. the radical left dems are killing our cities. nypd chief is resigning!so sad to see what is happening in new york where governor cuomo   mayor deblasio are letting out 900 criminals some hardened  bad onto the sidewalks of our rapidly declining because of them city. the radical left dems are killing our cities. nypd commissioner is resigning!#electionnight  won 5 out of 6 elections in kentucky including 5 great candidates that i spoke for and introduced last night. @mattbevin picked up at least 15 points in last days but perhaps not enough (fake news will blame trump!). winning in mississippi governor race!congratulations to @tatereeves on winning governor of the great state of mississippi. our big rally on friday night moved the numbers from a tie to a big win. great reaction under pressure tate!our big kentucky rally on monday night had a massive impact on all of the races. the increase in governors race was at least 15 points and maybe 20! will be in louisiana for @eddierispone on wednesday night. big rally!based on the kentucky results mitch mcconnell @senatemajldr will win big in kentucky next year!“based on the things i’ve seen the democrats have no case or a weak case at best. i don’t think there are or will be well founded articles of impeachment here.” robert wray respected former prosecutor. it is a phony scam by the do nothing dems! @foxandfriendsthank you to kurt volker u.s. envoy to ukraine who said in his congressional testimony just released “you asked what conversations did i have about that quid pro quo et cetra. none because i didn’t know there was a quid pro quo.”  witch hunt!stock markets (all three) hit another all time  historic high yesterday! you are sooo lucky to have me as your president (just kidding!). spend your money well!just had a very good call with president @rterdogan of turkey. he informed me that they have captured numerous isis fighters that were reported to have escaped during the conflict – including a wife and sister of terrorist killer al baghdadi….....also talked about their border with syria the eradication of terrorism the ending of hostilities with the kurds and many other topics. look forward to seeing president erdogan next wednesday november 13th at the @whitehouse!years ago when media was legitimate people known as “fact checkers” would always call to check and see if a story was accurate. nowadays they don’t use “fact checkers” anymore they just write whatever they want!the story in the amazon washington post of course picked up by fake news cnn saying “president trump asked for ag barr to host a news conference clearing him on ukraine” is totally untrue and just another fake news story with anonymous sources that don’t exist........the lamestream media which is the enemy of the people is working overtime with made up stories in order to drive dissension and distrust!bill barr did not decline my request to talk about ukraine. the story was a fake washington post con job with an “anonymous” source that doesn’t exist. just read the transcript. the justice department already ruled that the call was good. we don’t have freedom of the press!the degenerate washington post made up the story about me asking bill barr to hold a news conference. never happened and there were no sources!read the transcript!based on the information released last night about the fake whistleblowers attorney the impeachment hoax should be ended immediately! there is no case except against the other side!“what did hunter biden do for the money?” @senjohnkennedy  a very good question. he and sleepy joe must testify!it was just explained to me that for next weeks fake hearing (trial) in the house as they interview never trumpers and others i get no lawyer  no due process. it is a pelosi schiff scam against the republican party and me. this witch hunt should not be allowed to proceed!the amazon washington post and three lowlife reporters matt zapotosky josh dawsey and carol leonnig wrote another fake news story without any sources (pure fiction) about bill barr  myself. we both deny this story which they knew before they wrote it. a garbage newspaper!the radical left dems and lamestream media are just trying to make it hard for republicans and me to win in 2020. the new impeachment hoax is already turning against them!stock market up big today. a new record. enjoy!'"
